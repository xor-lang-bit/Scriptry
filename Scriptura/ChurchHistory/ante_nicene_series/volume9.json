But even the writers and philosophers among them have wrongly alleged that the gods are such as are made in honour of God Almighty."

And if further it is fitting that one should approve the handiworks of a craftsman, how much more is it fitting that one should glorify the Creator of the craftsman?  For behold! when the Greeks made laws they did not perceive that by their laws they condemn their gods."
