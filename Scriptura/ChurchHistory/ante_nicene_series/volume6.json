						"text": "Gregory Thaumaturgus Intro Note:"
					},
					{
						"text": "Alexandria continues to be the head of Christian learning."
					},
					{
						"text": "It is delightful to trace the hand of God from generation to generation, as from father to son, interposing for the perpetuity of the faith."
					},
					{
						"text": "We have already observed the continuity of the great Alexandrian school: how it arose, and how Pantaenus begat Clement, and Clement begat Origen."
					},
					{
						"text": "So Origen begat Gregory, and so the Lord has provided for the spiritual generation of the Church's teachers, age after age, from the beginning."
					},
					{
						"text": "Truly, the Lord gave to Origen a holy seed, better than natural sons and daughters; as if, for his comfort, Isaiah had written, forbidding him to say, \"I am a dry tree\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Our Gregory has given us not a little of his personal adventures in his panegyric upon his master, and for his further history the reader need only be referred to what follows."
					},
					{
						"text": "But I am anxious to supply the dates, which are too loosely left to conjecture."
					},
					{
						"text": "As he was ordained a bishop \"very young,\" according to Eusebius, I suppose he must have been far enough under fifty, the age prescribed by the \"Apostolic Canons\" (so called), though probably not younger than thirty, the earliest canonical limit for the ordination of a presbyter."
					},
					{
						"text": "If we decide upon five and thirty, as a mean reckoning, we may with some confidence set his birth at  , dating back from his episcopate, which began."
					},
					{
						"text": "He was a native of Neo-Caesarea, the chief city of Pontus,—a fact that should modify what we have learned about Pontus from Tertullian."
					},
					{
						"text": "He was born of heathen parentage, and lived like other Gentile boys until his fourteenth year (circa  ), with the disadvantage of being more than ordinarily imbued by a mistaken father in the polytheism of Greece."
					},
					{
						"text": "At this period his father died; but his mother, carrying out the wishes of her husband, seems to have been not less zealous in furthering his education according to her pagan ideas."
					},
					{
						"text": "He was, evidently, the inheritor of moderate wealth; and, with his brother Athenodorus, he was placed under an accomplished teacher of grammar and rhetoric, from whom also he acquired a considerable knowledge of the Latin tongue."
					},
					{
						"text": "He was persuaded by the same master to use this accomplishment in acquiring some knowledge of the Roman laws."
					},
					{
						"text": "This is a very important point in his biography, and it brings us to an epoch in Christian history too little noted by any writer."
					},
					{
						"text": "I shall return to it very soon."
					},
					{
						"text": "We find him next going to Alexandria to study the New Platonism."
					},
					{
						"text": "He speaks of himself as already prepossessed with Christian ideas, which came to him even in his boyhood, about the time when his father died."
					},
					{
						"text": "But it was not at Alexandria that he began his acquaintance with Christian learning."
					},
					{
						"text": "Next he seems to have travelled into Greece, and to have studied at Athens."
					},
					{
						"text": "But the great interest of his autobiography begins with the providential incidents, devoutly narrated by himself, which engaged him in a journey to Berytus just as Origen reached Caesarea,  , making it for a time his home and the seat of his school."
					},
					{
						"text": "His own good angel, as Gregory supposes, led him away from Berytus, where he purposed to prosecute his legal studies, and brought him to the feet of Origen, his Gamaliel; and \"from the very first day of his receiving us,\" he says, \"the true Sun began to rise upon me\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "This he accounts the beginning of his true life; and, if we are right as to our dates, he was now about twenty-seven years of age."
					},
					{
						"text": "If he tarried even a little while in Berytus, as seems probable, his knowledge of law was, doubtless, somewhat advanced."
					},
					{
						"text": "It was the seat of that school in which Roman law began its existence in the forms long afterward digested into the Pandects of Justinian."
					},
					{
						"text": "That emperor speaks of Berytus as \"the mother and nurse\" of the civil law."
					},
					{
						"text": "Caius, whose Institutes were discovered in  by the sagacity of Niebuhr, seems to have been a Syrian."
					},
					{
						"text": "So were Papinian and Ulpian: and, heathen as they were, they lived under the illumination reflected from Antioch; and, not less than the Antonines, they were examples of a philosophic regeneration which never could have existed until the Christian era had begun its triumphs."
					},
					{
						"text": "Of this sort of pagan philosophy Julian became afterwards the grand embodiment; and in Julian's grudging confessions of what he had learned from Christianity we have a key to the secret convictions of others, such as I have named; characters in whom, as in Plutarch and in many retrograde unbelievers of our day, we detect the operation of influences they are unwilling to acknowledge; of which, possibly, they are blindly unconscious themselves."
					},
					{
						"text": "Roman law, I maintain, therefore, indirectly owes its origin, as it is directly indebted for its completion in the Pandects, to the new powers and processes of thought which came from \"the Light of the World\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "It was light from Galilee and Golgotha, answering Pilate's question in the inward convictions of many a heathen sage."
					},
					{
						"text": "It is most interesting, therefore, to find in our Gregory one who had come into contact with Berytus at this period."
					},
					{
						"text": "He describes it as already dignified by this school of law, and therefore Latinized in some degree by its influence."
					},
					{
						"text": "Most suggestive is what he says of this school: \"I refer to those admirable laws of our sages, by which the affairs of all the subjects of the Roman Empire are now directed, and which are neither digested nor learnt without difficulty."
					},
					{
						"text": "They are wise and strict (if not pious) in themselves, they are manifold and admirable, and, in a word, most thoroughly Grecian, although expressed and delivered to us in the Roman tongue, which is a wonderful and magnificent sort of language, and one very aptly conformable to imperial authority, but still difficult to me\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Nor is this the only noteworthy tribute of our author to Roman law while yet that sublime system was in its cradle."
					},
					{
						"text": "The rhetorician who introduced him to it and to the Latin tongue was its enthusiastic eulogist; and Gregory says he learned the laws \"in a thorough way, by his help."
					},
					{
						"text": "…And he said one thing to me which has proved to me the truest of all his sayings; to wit, that my education in the laws would be my greatest viaticum,—my ἐφόδιον (for thus he phrased it);\" i-e:, for the journey of life."
					},
					{
						"text": "This man, one can hardly doubt, was a disciple of Caius (or Gaius); and there is little question that the digested system which Gregory eulogizes was \"the Institutes\" of that great father of the civil law, now recovered from a palimpsest, and made known to our own age, with no less benefit to jurisprudence than the discovery of the Philosophumena has conferred on theology."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thus Gregory's Panegyric throws light on the origin of Roman law."
					},
					{
						"text": "He claims it for \"our sages,\" meaning men of the East, whose vernacular was the Greek tongue."
					},
					{
						"text": "Caius was probably, like the Gaius of Scripture, an Oriental who had borrowed a Latin name, as did the Apostle of the Gentiles and many others."
					},
					{
						"text": "If he was a native of Berytus, as seems probable, that accounts for the rise of the school of laws at a place comparatively inconsiderable."
					},
					{
						"text": "Hadrian, in his journey to Palestine, would naturally discover and patronize such a jurist; and that accounts for the appearance of Caius at Rome in his day."
					},
					{
						"text": "Papinian and Ulpian, both Orientals, were his pupils in all probability; and these were the \"sages\" with whose works the youthful Gregory became acquainted, and by which his mind was prepared for the great influence he exerted in the East, where his name is a power to this day."
					},
					{
						"text": "His credit with our times is rather impaired than heightened by the epithet Thaumaturgus, which clings to his name as a convenient specification, to distinguish him from the other Gregories whose period was so nearly his own."
					},
					{
						"text": "But why make it his opprobrium? He is not responsible for the romances that sprung up after his death; which he never heard of nor imagined."
					},
					{
						"text": "Like the great Friar Bacon, who was considered a magician, or Faust, whose invention nearly cost him his life, the reputation of Gregory made him the subject of legendary lore long after he was gone."
					},
					{
						"text": "It is not impossible that God wrought marvels by his hand, but a single instance would give rise to many fables; and this very surname is of itself a monument of the fact that miracles were now of rare occurrence, and that one possessing the gift was a wonder to his contemporaries."
					},
					{
						"text": "To like popular love of the marvellous I attribute the stupid story of a mock consecration by Phaedimus."
					},
					{
						"text": "If a slight irregularity in Origen's ordination gave him such lifelong troubles, what would not have been the tumult such a sacrilege as this would have occasioned? Nothing is more probable than that Phaedimus related such things as having occurred in a vision; and this might have weighed with a mind like Gregory's to overcome his scruples, and to justify his acceptance of such a position at an early age."
					},
					{
						"text": "We are already acquainted with the eloquent letter of Origen that decided him to choose the sacred calling after he left the school at Caesarea."
					},
					{
						"text": "The Panegyric, which was his valedictory, doubtless called forth that letter."
					},
					{
						"text": "Origen had seen in him the makings of a κῆρυξ, and coveted such another Timothy for the Master's work."
					},
					{
						"text": "But the Panegyric itself abounds with faults, and greatly resembles similar college performances of our day."
					},
					{
						"text": "The custom of schools alone can excuse the expression of such enthusiastic praise in the presence of its subject; but Origen doubtless bore it as philosophically as others have done since, and its evident sincerity and heartfelt gratitude redeem it from the charge of fulsome adulation."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the residue of the story I may refer my readers to the statements of the translator, as follows:—  Translator's Notice."
					},
					{
						"text": "We are in possession of a considerable body of testimonies from ancient literature bearing on the life and work of Gregory."
					},
					{
						"text": "From these, though they are largely mixed up with the marvellous, we gain a tolerably clear and satisfactory view of the main facts in his history, and the most patent features of his character."
					},
					{
						"text": "From various witnesses we learn that he was also known by the name Theodorus, which may have been his original designation; that he was a native of Neo-Caesareia, a considerable place of trade, and one of the most important towns of Pontus; that he belonged to a family of some wealth and standing; that he was born of heathen parents; that at the age of fourteen he lost his father; that he had a brother named Athenodorus; and that along with him he travelled about from city to city in the prosecution of studies that were to fit him for the profession of law, to which he had been destined."
					},
					{
						"text": "Among the various seats of learning which he thus visited we find Alexandria, Athens, Berytus, and the Palestinian Caesareia mentioned."
					},
					{
						"text": "At this last place—to which, as he tells us, he was led by a happy accident in the providence of God—he was brought into connection with Origen."
					},
					{
						"text": "Under this great teacher he received lessons in logic, geometry, physics, ethics, philosophy, and ancient literature, and in due time also in biblical science and the verities of the Christian faith."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thus, having become Origen's pupil, he became also by the hand of God his convert."
					},
					{
						"text": "After a residence of some five years with the great Alexandrian, he returned to his native city."
					},
					{
						"text": "Soon, however, a letter followed him to Neo-Caesareia, in which Origen urged him to dedicate himself to the ministry of the Church of Christ, and pressed strongly upon him his obligation to consecrate his gifts to the service of God, and in especial to devote his acquirements in heathen science and learning to the elucidation of the Scriptures."
					},
					{
						"text": "On receipt of this letter, so full of wise and faithful counsel and strong exhortation, from the teacher whom he venerated and loved above all others, he withdrew into the wilderness, seeking opportunity for solemn thought and private prayer over its contents."
					},
					{
						"text": "At this time the bishop of Amasea, a city which held apparently a first place in the province, was one named Phaedimus, who, discerning the promise of great things in the convert, sought to make him bishop of Neo-Caesareia."
					},
					{
						"text": "For a considerable period, however, Gregory, who shrank from the responsibility of the episcopal office, kept himself beyond the bishop's reach, until Phaedimus, unsuccessful in his search, had recourse to the stratagem of ordaining him in his absence, and declaring him, with all the solemnities of the usual ceremonial, bishop of his native city."
					},
					{
						"text": "On receiving the report of this extraordinary step, Gregory yielded, and, coming forth from the place of his concealment, was consecrated to the bishopric with all the customary formalities; and so well did he discharge the duties of his office, that while there were said to be only seventeen Christians in the whole city when he first entered it as bishop, there were said to be only seventeen pagans in it at the time of his death."
					},
					{
						"text": "The date of his studies under Origen is fixed at about  , and that of his ordination as bishop at about."
					},
					{
						"text": "About the year  his church was involved in the sufferings of the Decian persecution, on which occasion he fled into the wilderness, with the hope of preserving his life for his people, whom he also counselled to follow in that matter his example."
					},
					{
						"text": "His flock had much to endure, again, through the incursion of the northern barbarians about."
					},
					{
						"text": "He took part in the council that met at Antioch in  for the purpose of trying Paul of Samosata; and soon after that he died, perhaps about , if we can adopt the conjectural reading which gives the name Aurelian instead of Julian in the account left us by Suidas."
					},
					{
						"text": "The surname Thaumaturgus, or Wonder-worker, at once admonishes us of the marvellous that so largely connected itself with the historical in the ancient records of this man's life."
					},
					{
						"text": "He was believed to have been gifted with a power of working miracles, which he was constantly exercising."
					},
					{
						"text": "But into these it is profitless to enter."
					},
					{
						"text": "When all the marvellous is dissociated from the historical in the records of this bishop's career, we have still the figure of a great, good, and gifted man, deeply versed in the heathen lore and science of his time, yet more deeply imbued with the genuine spirit of another wisdom, which, under God, he learned from the illustrious thinker of Alexandria, honouring with all love, gratitude, and veneration that teacher to whom he was indebted for his knowledge of the Gospel, and exercising an earnest, enlightened, and faithful ministry of many years in an office which he had not sought, but for which he had been sought."
					},
					{
						"text": "Such is, in brief, the picture that rises up before us from a perusal of his own writings, as well as from the comparison of ancient accounts of the man and his vocation."
					},
					{
						"text": "Of his well-accredited works we have the following: A Declaration of Faith, being a creed on the doctrine of the Trinity; a Metaphrase of the Book of Ecclesiastes, a Panegyric to Origen, being an oration delivered on leaving the school of Origen, expressing eloquently, and with great tenderness of feeling, as well as polish of style, the sense of his obligations to that master; and a Canonical Epistle, in which he gives a variety of directions with respect to the penances and discipline to be exacted by the Church from Christians who had fallen back into heathenism in times of suffering, and wished to be restored."
					},
					{
						"text": "Other works have been attributed to him, which are doubtful or spurious."
					},
					{
						"text": "His writings have been often edited,—by Gerard Voss in , by the Paris editors in , by Gallandi in , and others, who need not be enumerated here."

() How could the active intellect of an Origen have failed to make great mistakes in such an immensity of labours and such a variety of works?

Blessed art Thou, O Lord! How great is this example of the endurance of evil that Thou hast shown us in Thine own person! how great, too, the pattern of lowliness!

When it is thus covered, and when the body of the earth stands opposite it, a shadow is superinduced, which produces from itself the darkness; and it continues so until again, after the course of the inferior space has been traversed in the night, it rolls towards the east, and is seen to rise once more in its wonted seats."

					},
					{
						"text": "Orthodoxus."
					},
					{
						"text": "Well, then, I do not suppose you are ignorant that it is impossible for two uncreated things to exist together, although you seem to have expressed nearly as much as this in an earlier part of the conversation."
					},
					{
						"text": "Assuredly we must of necessity say one of two things: either that God is separate from matter, or, on the other hand, that He is inseparable from it."
					},
					{
						"text": "If, then, one would say that they are united, he will say that that which is uncreated is one only, for each of the things spoken of will be a part of the other; and as they are parts of each other, there will not be two uncreated things, but one composed of different elements."
					},
					{
						"text": "For we do not, because a man has different members, break him up into many beings."
					},
					{
						"text": "But, as the demands of reason require, we say that a single being, man, of many parts, has been created by God."
					},
					{
						"text": "So it is necessary, if God be not separate from matter, to say that that which is uncreated is one only; but if one shall say that He is separate, there must necessarily be something intermediate between the two, which makes their separation evident."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it is impossible to estimate the distance of one thing from another, unless there be something else with which the distance between them may be compared."
					},
					{
						"text": "And this holds good, not only as far as the instance before us, but also to any number of others."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the argument which we advanced in the case of two uncreated things would of necessity be of equal force, were the uncreated things granted to be three in number."
					},
					{
						"text": "For I should ask also respecting them, whether they are separate from each other, or, on the other hand, are united each to its neighbour."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if any one resolve to say that they are united, he will be told the same as before; if, again, that they are separate, he will not escape the necessary existence of that which separates them."
					},
					{
						"text": "If, then, any one were to say that there is a third account which might fitly be given of uncreated things, namely, that neither is God separate from matter, nor, again, are they united as part of a whole; but that God is locally situate in matter, and matter in God, he must be told as the consequence, that if we say that God is placed in matter, we must of necessity say that He is contained within limits, and circumscribed by matter."
					},
					{
						"text": "But then He must, equally with matter, be carried about without order."
					},
					{
						"text": "And that He rests not, nor remains by Himself, is a necessary result of that in which He is being carried, now this way, and now that."
					},
					{
						"text": "And besides this, we must say that God was in worse case still."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if matter were once without order, and He, determining to change it for the better, put it into order, there was a time when God was in that which had no order."
					},
					{
						"text": "And I might fairly ask this question also, whether God filled matter completely, or existed in some part of it."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if one resolve to say that God was in some part of matter, how far smaller than matter does he make Him; that is, if a part of it contained God altogether."
					},
					{
						"text": "But if he were to say that He is in all of it, and is extended through the whole of matter, he must tell us how He wrought upon it."
					},
					{
						"text": "For we must say that there was a sort of contraction of God, which being effected, He wrought upon that from which He was withdrawn, or else that He wrought in union with matter, without having a place of withdrawal."
					},
					{
						"text": "But if any one say that matter is in God, there is equal need of inquiry, namely, whether it is by His being separated from Himself, and as creatures exist in the air, by His being divided and parted for the reception of the beings that are in Him; or whether it is locally situated, that is to say, as water in land; for if we were to say, as in the air, we must say that God is divisible; but if, as water in earth,—since matter was without order and arrangement, and besides, contained what was evil,—we must say, that in God were to be found the disorderly and the evil."
					},
					{
						"text": "Now this seems to me an unbecoming conclusion, nay, more a dangerous one."
					},
					{
						"text": "For you wish for the existence of matter, that you may avoid saying that God is the author of evil; and, determining to avoid this, you say that He is the receptacle of evil."
					},
					{
						"text": "If, then, under the supposition that matter is separate from created substances, you had said that it is uncreated, I should have said much about it, to prove that it is impossible for it to be uncreated; but since you say that the question of the origin of evil is the cause of this supposition, it therefore seems to me right to proceed to inquire into this."
					},
					{
						"text": "For when it is clearly stated how evil exists, and that it is not possible to say that God is the cause of evil, because of matter being subject to Him, it seems to me to destroy such a supposition, to remark, that if God created the qualities which did not exist, He equally created the substances."
					},
					{
						"text": "Do you say then, that there co-exists with God matter without qualities out of which He formed the beginning of this world?  Valentinian."
					},
					{
						"text": "So I think."
					},
					{
						"text": "Orthodoxus."
					},
					{
						"text": "If, then, matter had no qualities, and the world were produced by God, and qualities exist in the world, then God is the maker of qualities?  Valentinian."
					},
					{
						"text": "It is so."
					},
					{
						"text": "Orthodoxus."
					},
					{
						"text": "Now, as I heard you say some time ago that it is impossible for anything to come into being out of that which has no existence, answer my question: Do you think that the qualities of the world were not produced out of any existing qualities?  Valentinian."
					},
					{
						"text": "I do."
					},
					{
						"text": "Orthodoxus."
					},
					{

					},
					{
						"text": "Yes."
					},
					{
						"text": "Orthodoxus."
					},
					{
						"text": "If, then, qualities were neither made by God out of any ready at hand, nor derive their existence from substances, because they are not substances, we must say that they were produced by God out of what had no existence."
					},
					{
						"text": "Wherefore I thought you spoke extravagantly in saying that it was impossible to suppose that anything was produced by God out of what did not exist."
					},
					{
						"text": "But let our discussion of this matter stand thus."
					},
					{
						"text": "For truly we see among ourselves men making things out of what does not exist, although they seem for the most part to be making them with something."
					},
					{
						"text": "As, for instance, we may have an example in the case of architects; for they truly do not make cities out of cities, nor in like manner temples out of temples."
					},
					{
						"text": "•                      •                      •                      •                      •                      •  But if, because substances underlie these things, you think that the builders make them out of what does exist, you are mistaken in your calculation."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it is not the substance which makes the city or the temples, but art applied to substance."
					},
					{
						"text": "And this art is not produced out of some art which lies in the substances themselves, but from that which is not in them."
					},
					{
						"text": "But you seem likely to meet me with this argument: that the artificer makes the art which is connected with the substance out of the art which he has."
					},
					{
						"text": "Now I think it is a good reply to this to say, that in man it is not produced from any art lying beneath; for it is not to be granted that substance by itself is art."
					},
					{
						"text": "For art is in the class of accidents, and is one of the things that have an existence only when they are employed about some substance."
					},
					{
						"text": "For man will exist even without the art of building, but it will have no existence unless man be previously in being."

					{
						"text": "For I say that man was made not for destruction, but for better things."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if he were made as any of the elements, or those things which render a similar service to God, he would cease to receive a reward befitting deliberate choice, and would be like an instrument of the maker; and it would be unreasonable for him to suffer blame for his wrong-doings, for the real author of them is the one by whom he is used."
					},
					{
						"text": "But man did not understand better things, since he did not know the author (of his existence), but only the object for which he was made."
					},
					{
						"text": "I say therefore that God, purposing thus to honour man, and to grant him an understanding of better things, has given him the power of being able to do what he wishes, and commends the employment of his power for better things; not that He deprives him again of free-will, but wishes to point out the better way."
					},

God appointed this as an example and introduction to the day that is coming, in order that we may know more certainly that, when all things are deluged with fire from heaven, the bodies which are distinguished by chastity and righteousness will be taken up by Him as free from all injury from the fire as from cold water."

Christ, the Son of God, by the command of the Father, became conversant with the visible creature, in order that, by overturning the dominion of the tyrants, the demons, that is, He might deliver our souls from their dreadful bondage, by reason of which our whole nature, intoxicated by the draughts of iniquity, had become full of tumult and disorder, and could by no means return to the remembrance of good and useful things."

Have these first elements, from which it is agreed that all things were compacted, been altered into elements of an opposite character? Has the fabric of this machine and mass of the universe, by which we are all covered, and in which we are held enclosed, relaxed in any part, or broken up? Has the revolution of the globe, to which we are accustomed, departing from the rate of its primal motion, begun either to move too slowly, or to be hurried onward in headlong rotation? Have the stars begun to rise in the west, and the setting of the constellations to take place in the east? Has the sun himself, the chief of the heavenly bodies, with whose light all things are clothed, and by whose heat all things are vivified, blazed forth with increased vehemence? has he become less warm, and has he altered for the worse into opposite conditions that well-regulated temperature by which he is wont to act upon the earth? Has the moon ceased to shape herself anew, and to change into former phases by the constant recurrence of fresh ones? Has the cold of winter, has the heat of summer, has the moderate warmth of spring and autumn, been modified by reason of the intermixture of ill-assorted seasons? Has the winter begun to have long days? has the night begun to recall the very tardy twilights of summer? Have the winds at all exhausted their violence? Is the sky not collected into clouds by reason of the blasts having lost their force, and do the fields when moistened by the showers not prosper? Does the earth refuse to receive the seed committed to it, or will not the trees assume their foliage? Has the flavour of excellent fruits altered, or has the vine changed in its juice? Is foul blood pressed forth from the olive berries, and is oil no longer supplied to the lamp, now extinguished? Have animals of the land and of the sea no sexual desires, and do they not conceive young? Do they not guard, according to their own habits and their own instinct, the offspring generated in their wombs? In fine, do men themselves, whom an active energy with its first impulses has scattered over habitable lands, not form marriages with due rites? Do they not beget dear children? do they not attend to public, to individual, and to family concerns? Do they not apply their talents as each one pleases, to varied occupations, to different kinds of learning? and do they not reap the fruit of diligent application? Do those to whom it has been so allotted, not exercise kingly power or military authority? Are men not every day advanced in posts of honour, in offices of power? Do they not preside in the discussions of the law courts? Do they not explain the code of law? do they not expound the principles of equity?

Would it not have been better to dance and to sing, than calling it gravity and pretending to be serious, to relate what is so insipid and so silly, that images were formed by the ancients to check wrongdoing, and to arouse the fears of the wicked and impious? Were the men of that age and time, in understanding, so void of reason and good sense, that they were kept back from wicked actions, just as if they were little boys, by the preternatural savageness of masks, by grimaces also, and bugbears? And how has this been so entirely changed, that though there are so many temples in your states filled with images of all the gods, the multitude of criminals cannot be resisted even with so many laws and so terrible punishments, and their audacity cannot be overcome by any means, and wicked deeds, repeated again and again, multiply the more it is striven by laws and severe judgments to lessen the number of cruel deeds, and to quell them by the check given by means of punishments? But if images caused any fear to men, the passing of laws would cease, nor would so many kinds of tortures be established against the daring of the guilty: now, however, because it has been proved and established that the supposed terror which is said to flow out from the images is in reality vain, recourse has been had to the ordinances of laws, by which there might be a dread of punishment which should be most certain fixed in men's minds also, and a condemnation settled; to which these very images also owe it that they yet stand safe, and secured by some respect being yielded to them."
