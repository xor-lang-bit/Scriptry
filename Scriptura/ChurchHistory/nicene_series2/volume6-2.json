						"text": "You have frequently asked me, dearest Innocent, not to pass over in silence the marvellous event which has happened in our own day."
					},
					{
						"text": "I have declined the task from modesty and, as I now feel, with justice, believing myself to be incapable of it, at once because human language is inadequate to the divine praise, and because inactivity, acting like rust upon the intellect, has dried up any little power of expression that I have ever had."
					},
					{
						"text": "You in reply urge that in the things of God we must look not at the work which we are able to accomplish, but at the spirit in which it is undertaken, and that he can never be at a loss for words who has believed on the Word."

					},
					{
						"text": "I have not so much as handled a rowboat on a lake, and now I have to trust myself to the noise and turmoil of the Euxine."
					},
					{
						"text": "I see the shores sinking beneath the horizon, \"sky and sea on every side\"; darkness lowers over the water, the clouds are black as night, the waves only are white with foam."
					},
					{
						"text": "You urge me to hoist the swelling sails, to loosen the sheets, and to take the helm."
					},
					{
						"text": "At last I obey your commands, and as charity can do all things, I will trust in the Holy Ghost to guide my course, and I shall console myself, whatever the event."
					},
					{
						"text": "For, if our ship is wafted by the surf into the wished-for haven, I shall be content to be told that the pilotage was poor."
					},
					{
						"text": "But, if through my unpolished diction we run aground amid the rough cross-currents of language, you may blame my lack of power, but you will at least recognize my good intentions."

					{
						"text": "To begin, then: Vercellae is a Ligurian town, situated not far from the base of the Alps, once important, but now sparsely peopled and fallen into decay."
					},
					{
						"text": "When the consular was holding his visitation there, a poor woman and her paramour were brought before him—the charge of adultery had been fastened upon them by the husband—and were both consigned to the penal horrors of a prison."
					},
					{
						"text": "Shortly after an attempt was made to elicit the truth by torture, and when the blood-stained hook smote the young man's livid flesh and tore furrows in his side, the unhappy wretch sought to avoid prolonged pain by a speedy death."
					},
					{
						"text": "Falsely accusing his own passions, he involved another in the charge; and it appeared that he was of all men the most miserable, and that his execution was just inasmuch as he had left to an innocent woman no means of self-defence."
					},
					{
						"text": "But the woman, stronger in virtue if weaker in sex, though her frame was stretched upon the rack, and though her hands, stained with the filth of the prison, were tied behind her, looked up to heaven with her eyes, which alone the torturer had been unable to bind, and while the tears rolled down her face, said: \"Thou art witness, Lord Jesus, to whom nothing is hid, who triest the reins and the heart."
					},

					},
					{
						"text": "The consular, who had been feasting his eyes upon the bloody spectacle, now, like a wild beast, which after once tasting blood always thirsts for it, ordered the torture to be doubled, and cruelly gnashing his teeth, threatened the executioner with like punishment if he failed to extort from the weaker sex a confession which a man's strength had not been able to keep back."
					},

					{
						"text": "Send help, Lord Jesus."
					},
					{
						"text": "For this one creature of Thine every species of torture is devised."
					},

					},

						"text": "Wearied out at last, the torturer sighed in response to her groans; nor could he find a spot on which to inflict a fresh wound."
					},
					{
						"text": "His cruelty overcome, he shuddered to see the body he had torn."
					},
					{
						"text": "Immediately the consular cried, in a fit of passion, \"Why does it surprise you, bystanders, that a woman prefers torture to death? It takes two people, most assuredly, to commit adultery; and I think it more credible that a guilty woman should deny a sin than that an innocent young man should confess one\"."
					},

						"text": "7."
					},
					{
						"text": "Like sentence, accordingly, was passed on both, and the condemned pair were dragged to execution."

					},
					{
						"text": "At the very first stroke of the sword the head of the hapless youth was cut off, and the headless trunk rolled over in its blood."
					},
					{
						"text": "Then came the woman's turn."
					},
					{
						"text": "She knelt down upon the ground, and the shining sword was lifted over her quivering neck."
					},
					{
						"text": "But though the headsman summoned all his strength into his bared arm, the moment it touched her flesh the fatal blade stopped short, and, lightly glancing over the skin, merely grazed it sufficiently to draw blood."
					},
					{
						"text": "The striker saw, with terror, his hand unnerved, and, amazed at his defeated skill and at his drooping sword, he whirled it aloft for another stroke."
					},
					{
						"text": "Again the blade fell forceless on the woman, sinking harmlessly on her neck, as though the steel feared to touch her."
					},
					{
						"text": "The enraged and panting officer, who had thrown open his cloak at the neck to give his full strength to the blow, shook to the ground the brooch which clasped the edges of his mantle, and not noticing this, began to poise his sword for a fresh stroke."
					},
					{
						"text": "\"See,\" cried the woman, \"a jewel has fallen from your shoulder."
					},
					{
						"text": "Pick up what you have earned by hard toil, that you may not lose it\"."
					},

						"text": "8."
					},
					{
						"text": "What, I ask, is the secret of such confidence as this? Death draws near, but it has no terrors for her."
					},
					{
						"text": "When smitten she exults, and the executioner turns pale."
					},
					{
						"text": "Her eyes see the brooch, they fail to see the sword."
					},
					{
						"text": "And, as if intrepidity in the presence of death were not enough, she confers a favor upon her cruel foe."
					},
					{
						"text": "And now the mysterious Power of the Trinity rendered even a third blow vain."
					},
					{
						"text": "The terrified soldier, no longer trusting the blade, proceeded to apply the point to her throat, in the idea that though it might not cut, the pressure of his hand might plunge it into her flesh."
					},
					{
						"text": "Marvel unheard of through all the ages! The sword bent back to the hilt, and in its defeat looked to its master, as if confessing its inability to slay."
					},
					{
						"text": "9."
					},
					{
						"text": "Let me call to my aid the example of the three children, who, amid the cool, encircling fire, sang hymns, instead of weeping, and around whose turbans and holy hair the flames played harmlessly."
					},
					{
						"text": "Let me recall, too, the story of the blessed Daniel, in whose presence, though he was their natural prey, the lions crouched, with fawning tails and frightened mouths."
					},
					{
						"text": "Let Susannah also rise in the nobility of her faith before the thoughts of all; who, after she had been condemned by an unjust sentence, was saved through a youth inspired by the Holy Ghost."
					},
					{
						"text": "In both cases the Lord's mercy was alike shewn; for while Susannah was set free by the judge, so as not to die by the sword, this woman, though condemned by the judge, was acquitted by the sword."
					},
					{
						"text": "10."
					},
					{
						"text": "Now at length the populace rise in arms to defend the woman."
					},
					{
						"text": "Men and women of every age join in driving away the executioner, shouting round him in a surging crowd."
					},
					{
						"text": "Hardly a man dares trust his own eyes."
					},
					{
						"text": "The disquieting news reaches the city close at hand, and the entire force of constables is mustered."
					},
					{
						"text": "The officer who is responsible for the execution of criminals bursts from among his men, and  Staining his hoary hair with soiling dust,  exclaims: \"What! citizens, do you mean to seek my life? Do you intend to make me a substitute for her? However much your minds are set on mercy, and however much you wish to save a condemned woman, yet assuredly I—I who am innocent—ought not to perish\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "His tearful appeal tells upon the crowd, they are all benumbed by the influence of sorrow, and an extraordinary change of feeling is manifested."
					},
					{
						"text": "Before it had seemed a duty to plead for the woman's life, now it seemed a duty to allow her to be executed."
					},
					{
						"text": "11."
					},
					{
						"text": "Accordingly a new sword is fetched, a new headsman appointed."
					},
					{
						"text": "The victim takes her place, once more strengthened only with the favor of Christ."
					},
					{
						"text": "The first blow makes her quiver, beneath the second she sways to and fro, by the third she falls wounded to the ground."
					},
					{
						"text": "Oh, majesty of the divine power highly to be extolled! She who previously had received four strokes without injury, now, a few moments later, seems to die that an innocent man may not perish in her stead."
					},

						"text": "12."

					{
						"text": "Those of the clergy whose duty it is to wrap the blood-stained corpse in a winding-sheet, dig out the earth and, heaping together stones, form the customary tomb."
					},
					{
						"text": "The sunset comes on quickly, and by God's mercy the night of nature arrives more swiftly than is its wont."
					},
					{
						"text": "Suddenly the woman's bosom heaves, her eyes seek the light, her body is quickened into new life."
					},
					{
						"text": "A moment after she sighs, she looks round, she gets up and speaks."
					},
					{

						"text": "What can man do unto me?\"  13."
					},
					{
						"text": "Meantime an aged woman, supported out of the funds of the church, gave back her spirit to heaven from which it came."
					},
					{
						"text": "It seemed as if the course of events had been thus purposely ordered, for her body took the place of the other beneath the mound."
					},
					{
						"text": "In the gray dawn the devil comes on the scene in the form of a constable, asks for the corpse of her who had been slain, and desires to have her grave pointed out to him."
					},
					{
						"text": "Surprised that she could have died, he fancies her to be still alive."
					},
					{
						"text": "The clergy show him the fresh turf, and meet his demands by pointing to the earth lately heaped up, taunting him with such words as these: \"Yes, of course, tear up the bones which have been buried! Declare war anew against the tomb, and if even that does not satisfy you, pluck her limb from limb for birds and beasts to mangle! Mere dying is too good for one whom it took seven strokes to kill\"."
					},

						"text": "14."
					},

						"text": "Then, lest the frequency of the doctor's visits to the church might give occasion for suspicion, they cut her hair short and send her in the company of some virgins to a sequestered country house."
					},
					{
						"text": "There she changes her dress for that of a man, and scars form over her wounds."
					},
					{
						"text": "Yet even after the great miracles worked on her behalf, the laws still rage against her."
					},
					{
						"text": "So true is it that, where there is most law, there, there is also most injustice."

					{
						"text": "But now see whither the progress of my story has brought me; we come upon the name of our friend Evagrius."
					},
					{
						"text": "So great have his exertions been in the cause of Christ that, were I to suppose it possible adequately to describe them, I should only show my own folly; and were I minded deliberately to pass them by, I still could not prevent my voice from breaking out into cries of joy."
					},
					{
						"text": "Who can fittingly praise the vigilance which enabled him to bury, if I may so say, before his death Auxentius of Milan, that curse brooding over the church? Or who can sufficiently extol the discretion with which he rescued the Roman bishop from the toils of the net in which he was fairly entangled, and showed him the means at once of overcoming his opponents and of sparing them in their discomfiture? But  Such topics I must leave to other bards,  Shut out by envious straits of time and space."
					},
					{
						"text": "I am satisfied now to record the conclusion of my tale."
					},
					{
						"text": "Evagrius seeks a special audience of the Emperor; importunes him with his entreaties, wins his favor by his services, and finally gains his cause through his earnestness."
					},

						"text": "The Emperor restored to liberty the woman whom God had restored to life."

The priest, we know, offers his oblation for the layman, lays his hand upon him when submissive, invokes the return of the Holy Spirit, and thus, after inviting the prayers of the people, reconciles to the altar him who had been delivered to Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit might he saved; nor does he restore one member to health until all the members have wept together with him."
