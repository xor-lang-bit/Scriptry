					},
					{
						"text": "That my meaning may be clearer, I will read it according to its sense thus: \"Paul and Sosthenes to the Church of God which is in Corinth and to all who call upon the Name of Him who is both our Lord and theirs in every place, whether in Rome or wheresoever else they may be: grace unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ\"."

					},
					{
						"text": "Now if our peace be of grace, why hast thou high thoughts? Why art Thou so puffed up, being saved by grace? And if thou hast peace with God, why wish to assign thyself to others? since this is what separation comes to."
					},
					{
						"text": "For what if you be at \"peace\" with this man, and with the other even find \"grace?\" My prayer is that both these may be yours from God; both from Him I say, and towards Him."
					},
					{
						"text": "For neither do they abide (μένει, Savile in marg."
					},
					{
						"text": ") secure except they enjoy the influence from above; nor unless God be their object will they aught avail you: for it profiteth us nothing, though we be peaceful towards all men, if we be at war with God; even as it is no harm to us, although by all men we are held as enemies, if with God we are at peace."
					},
					{
						"text": "And again it is no gain to us, if all men approve, and the Lord be offended; neither is there any danger, though all shun and hate us, if with God we have acceptance and love."
					},
					{
						"text": "For that which is verily grace, and verily peace, cometh of God, since he who finds grace in God's sight, though he suffer ten thousand horrors, feareth no one; I say not only, no man, but not even the devil himself; but he that hath offended God suspects all men, though he seem to be in security."

					{
						"text": "For human nature is unstable, and not friends only and brethren, but fathers also, before now, have been altogether changed and often for a little thing he whom they begat, the branch of their planting, hath been to them, more than all foes, an object of persecution."
					},

Is it not he who refuses to admire the clay? And which, abject and mean? Is it not he who admires it, and set much store by it? Just so do thou esteem of this case also; that he who calls himself but dust and ashes is exalted, although he say it out of humility; but that he who does not consider himself dust and ashes, but treats himself lovingly and has high thoughts, this man for his part must be counted mean, esteeming little things to be great."

						"text": "And again, one man is tall from the stature of his person; another, being short, by adding buskins becomes taller; now tell me, which of the two should we call tall and large? Is it not quite plain, him whose height is from himself? For the other has it as something not his own; and stepping upon things low in themselves, turns out a tall person."

					},
					{

					},
					{
						"text": "For just as a man on the point of obtaining a kingdom, if instead of that purple robe one offer him some trivial compliment, will count it to be nothing; so shall we also laugh to scorn all things present, if we desire that other sort of honor."
					},
					{
						"text": "Do ye not see the children, when in their play they make a band of soldiers, and heralds precede them and lictors, and a boy marches in the midst in the general's place, how childish it all is? Just such are all human affairs; yea and more worthless than these: to-day they are, and to-morrow they are not."

					},
					{
						"text": "For, on the one hand, those who still retained the fear of idols and knew not how to contemn them, took part in those meals, because they saw the more perfect sort doing this; and hence they got the greatest injury: since they did not touch what was set before them with the same mind as the others, but as things offered in sacrifice to idols; and the thing was becoming a way to idolatry."
					},

					},
					{
						"text": "What then doeth he? First, by signifying that it was common, he curbs that swelling pride of theirs."
					},
					{
						"text": "For they who possess something great and excellent are more elated, when they alone have it; but if it be made out that they possess it in common with others, they no longer have so much of this feeling."

					},
					{
						"text": "Next, having made it common, he does not make himself singly a sharer in it with them; for in this way too he would have rather set them up; for as to be the only possessor elates, so to have one partner or two perhaps among leading persons has this effect just as much."

						"text": "Well: this he did not say; but omitting it as a thing allowed by all, he signifies that knowledge stands in extreme need of love."

						"text": "For he who loves, inasmuch as he fulfils the commandment which is most absolute of all, even though he have some defects, will quickly be blest with knowledge because of his love; as Cornelius and many others."
					},
					{
						"text": "But he that hath knowledge but hath not love, not only shall gain nothing more, but shall also be cast out of that which he hath, in many cases falling into arrogance."
					},
					{
						"text": "It seems then that knowledge is not productive of love, but on the contrary debars from it him that is not on his guard, puffing him up and elating him."
					},
					{
						"text": "For arrogance is wont to cause divisions: but love both draws together and leads to knowledge."
					},
					{
						"text": "And to make this plain he saith, \"But if any man loveth God, the same is known of Him\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "So that \"I forbid not this,\" saith he, \"namely, your having perfect knowledge; but your having it with love, that I enjoin; else is it no gain, but rather loss\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Do you see how he already sounds the first note of his discourse concerning love? For since all these evils were springing from the following root, i-e:, not from perfect knowledge, but from their not greatly loving nor sparing their neighbors; whence ensued both their variance and their self-satisfaction, and all the rest which he had charged them with; both before this and after he is continually providing for love; so correcting the fountain of all good things."

					{

					},
					{
						"text": "He did not say, \"Behaveth itself modestly,\" but what is much more, and more gainful."
					},
					{
						"text": "For their knowledge was not only puffing them up but also distracting them."
					},
					{
						"text": "On this account he opposes the one to the other."
					},
					{

						"text": "But even though you have it by yourself alone, though you be modest, though you love your brother, even in this case you are imperfect in regard of knowledge."
					},
					{
						"text": "\"For as yet thou knowest nothing as thou oughtest to know,\" Now if we possess as yet exact knowledge of nothing, how is it that some have rushed on to such a pitch of frenzy as to say that they know God with all exactness? Whereas, though we had an exact knowledge of all other things, not even so were it possible to possess this knowledge to such an extent."
					},
					{
						"text": "For how far He is apart from all things, it is impossible even to say."
					},
					{
						"text": "And mark how he pulls down their swelling pride: for he said not, \"of the matters before us ye have not the proper knowledge,\" but, \"about every thing\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "And he did not say, \"ye,\" but, \"no one whatever,\" be it Peter, be it Paul, be it any one else."
					},

						"text": "For by this he both soothed them and carefully kept them under."
					},
					{
						"text": "Ver."
					},
					{
						"text": "\"But if any man love God, the same,\" he doth not say, \"knoweth Him,\" but, \"is known of Him\"."

					},
					{
						"text": "And therefore did Christ say, \"Ye have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "And Paul elsewhere, \"Then shall I know fully, even as also I have been known\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Observe now, I pray, by what means he brings down their high-mindedness."
					},
					{
						"text": "First, he points out that not they alone knew the things which they knew; for \"we all,\" he saith,\" have knowledge\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Next, that the thing itself was hurtful so long as it was without love; for \"knowledge,\" saith he, \"puffeth up\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thirdly, that even joined with love it is not complete nor perfect."
					},
					{
						"text": "\"For if any man thinketh that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing as yet as he ought to know,\" so he speaks."
					},
					{
						"text": "In addition to this, that they have not even this from themselves, but by gift from God."
					},
					{
						"text": "For he said not, \"hath known God,\" but, \"is known of Him\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Again, that this very thing comes of love which they have not as they ought."
					},
					{
						"text": "For, \"if any man,\" saith he, \"love God, the same is known of Him\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Having then so much at large allayed their irritation, he begins to speak doctrinally, saying thus."
					},
					{
						"text": "Ver."
					},
					{
						"text": "\"Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no God but one\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Look what a strait he hath fallen into! For indeed his mind is to prove both; that one ought to abstain from this kind of banquet, and that it hath no power to hurt those who partake of it: things which were not greatly in agreement with each other."
					},
					{
						"text": "For when they were told that they had no harm in them, they would naturally run to them as indifferent things."
					},
					{
						"text": "But when forbidden to touch them, they would suspect, on the contrary, that their having power to do hurt occasioned the prohibition."
					},
					{
						"text": "Wherefore, you see, he puts down their opinion about idols, and then states as a first reason for their abstaining the scandals which they place in the way of their brethren; in these words: \"Now concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Again he makes it common property and doth not allow this to be theirs alone, but extends the knowledge all over the world."
					},
					{
						"text": "For \"not among you alone,\" says he, \"but every where on earth this doctrine prevails\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "What then is it? \"That no idol is anything in the world; that there is no God but one\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "What then? are there no idols? no statues? Indeed there are; but they have no power: neither are they gods, but stones and demons."
					},
					{
						"text": "For he is now setting himself against both parties; both the grosser sort among them, and those who were accounted lovers of wisdom."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thus, seeing that the former know of no more than the mere stones, the others assert that certain powers reside in them, which they also call gods; to the former accordingly he says, that \"no idol is anything in the world,\" to the other, that \"there is no God but one\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Do you mark how he writes these things, not simply as laying down doctrine, but in opposition to those without? A thing indeed which we must at all times narrowly observe, whether he says anything abstractedly, or whether he is opposing any persons."
					},
					{
						"text": "For this contributes in no ordinary way to the accuracy of our doctrinal views, and to the exact understanding of his expressions."
					},
					{
						"text": "Ver."
					},
					{
						"text": "\"For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, as there are gods many and lords many; yet to us there is one God, the Father, of Whom are all things, and we unto Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom are all things, and we through Him\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Since he had said, that \"an idol is nothing\" and that \"there is no other God;\" and yet there were idols and there were those that were called gods; that he might not seem to be contradicting plain facts, he goes on to say, \"For though there be that are called gods, as indeed there are;\" not absolutely, \"there are;\" but, \"called,\" not in reality having this but in name: \"be it in heaven or on earth:—in heaven,\" meaning the sun and the moon and the remainder of the choir of stars; for these too the Greeks worshipped: but upon the earth demons, and all those who had been made gods of men:—\"yet to us there is One God, the Father\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "In the first instance having expressed it without the word \"Father,\" and said, \"there is no God but one,\" he now adds this also, when he had utterly cast out the others."
					},
					{
						"text": "Next, he adduces what indeed is the greatest token of divinity; \"of Whom are all things\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "For this implies also that those others are not gods."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it is said (Jer."
					},
					{
						"text": "x."
					},

						"text": "), \"Let the gods who made not the heaven and the earth perish\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Then he subjoins what is not less than this, \"and we unto Him\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "For when he saith, \"of Whom are all things,\" he means the creation and the bringing of things out of nothing into existence."
					},
					{
						"text": "But when he saith, \"and we unto Him,\" he speaks of the word of faith and mutual appropriation (οἰκειώσεως), as also he said before ( Cor."
					},
					{
						"text": "i."
					},
					{
						"text": "), \"but of Him are ye also in Christ Jesus\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "In two ways we are of Him, by being made when we were not, and by being made believers."
					},
					{
						"text": "For this also is a creation: a thing which he also declares elsewhere; (Ephes."
					},
					{
						"text": "ii."
					},
					{
						"text": ") \"that He might create in Himself of the twain one new man\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "\"And there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through Whom are all things, and we through Him\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "And in regard to Christ again, we must conceive of this in like manner."
					},
					{
						"text": "For through Him the race of men was both produced out of nothing into existence, and returned from error to truth."
					},
					{
						"text": "So that as to the phrase \"of Whom,\" it is not to be understood apart from Christ."
					},
					{
						"text": "For of Him, through Christ, were we created."
					},
					{
						"text": "Nor yet, if you observe, hath he distributed the names as if belonging exclusively, assigning to the Son the name Lord, and to the Father, God."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the Scripture useth also often to interchange them; as when it saith, (Ps."
					},
					{

					},
					{
						"text": "And in many instances you may see these names changing their places."
					},
					{
						"text": "Besides, if they were allotted to each nature severally, and if the Son were not God, and God as the Father, yet continuing a Son: after saying, \"but to us there is but One God,\" it would have been superfluous, his adding the word \"Father,\" with a view to declare the Unbegotten."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the word of God was sufficient to explain this, if it were such as to denote Him only."
					},
					{
						"text": "And this is not all, but there is another remark to make: that if you say, \"Because it is said 'One God,' therefore the word God doth not apply to the Son;\" observe that the same holds of the Son also."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the Son also is called \"One Lord,\" yet we do not maintain that therefore the term Lord applies to Him alone."
					},
					{
						"text": "So then, the same force which the expression \"One\" has, applied to the Son, it has also, applied to the Father."
					},
					{
						"text": "And as the Father is not thrust out from being the Lord, in the same sense as the Son is the Lord, because He, the Son, is spoken of as one Lord; so neither does it cast out the Son from being God, in the same sense as the Father is God, because the Father is styled One God."
					},
					{
						"text": "Now if any were to say, \"Why did he make no mention of the Spirit?\" our answer might be this: His argument was with idolaters, and the contention was about \"gods many and lords many\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "And this is why, having called the Father, God, he calls the Son, Lord."
					},
					{
						"text": "If now he ventured not to call the Father Lord together with the Son, lest they might suspect him to be speaking of two Lords; nor yet the Son, God, with the Father, lest he might be supposed to speak of two Gods: why marvel at his not having mentioned the Spirit? His contest was, so far, with the Gentiles: his point, to signify that with us there is no plurality of Gods."
					},
					{
						"text": "Wherefore he keeps hold continually of this word, \"One;\" saying, \"There is no God but One; and, to us there is One God, and One Lord\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "From which it is plain, that to spare the weakness of the hearers he used this mode of explanation, and for this reason made no mention at all of the Spirit."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if it be not this, neither ought he to make mention of the Spirit elsewhere, nor to join Him with the Father and the Son."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if He be rejected from the Father and Son, much more ought He not to be put in the same rank with them in the matter of Baptism; where most especially the dignity of the Godhead appears and gifts are bestowed which pertain to God alone to afford."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thus then I have assigned the cause why in this place He is passed over in silence."
					},
					{
						"text": "Now do thou if this be not the true reason, tell me, why He is ranked with Them in Baptism? But thou canst not give any other reason but His being of equal honor."
					},

						"text": ") \"There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit: and there are diversities of administrations, but the same Lord; and there are diversities of workings but the same God\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "But because now his speech was with Greeks and the weaker sort of the converts from among Greeks, for this reason he husbands it (ταμιεύεται) so far."
					},
					{
						"text": "And this is what the prophets do in regard of the Son; no where making mention of Him plainly because of the infirmity of the hearers."

					},
					{
						"text": "\"But not in all is knowledge,\" saith he."
					},
					{
						"text": "What knowledge doth he mean? about God, or about things offered in sacrifice to idols? For either he here glances at the Greeks who say that there are many gods and lords, and who know not Him that is truly God; or at the converts from among Greeks who were still rather infirm, such as did not yet know clearly that they ought not to fear idols and that \"an idol is nothing in the world\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "But in saying this, he gently soothes and encourages the latter."
					},

					},
					{
						"text": "But carry back your thoughts to those times, and consider when the Gospel was just set on foot, and impiety was still at its height, and altars burning, and sacrifices and libations offering up, and the greater part of men were Gentiles; think, I say, of those who from their ancestors had received impiety, and who were the descendants of fathers and grandfathers and great-grandfathers like themselves, and who had suffered great miseries from the demons."
					},
					{
						"text": "How must they have felt after their sudden change! How would they face and tremble at the assaults of the demons! For their sake also he employs some reserve, saying, \"But some with conscience of the things sacrificed to an idol\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thus he neither exposed them openly, not to strike them hard; nor doth he pass by them altogether: but makes mention of them in a vague manner, saying, \"Now some with conscience of the idol even until now eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol; that is, with the same thoughts as they did in former times: 'and their conscience being weak is defiled;'\" not yet being able to despise and once for all laugh them to scorn, but still in some doubt."
					},
					{
						"text": "Just as if a man were to think that by touching a dead body he should pollute himself according to the Jewish custom, and then seeing others touching it with a clear conscience, but not with the same mind touching it himself, would be polluted."

					{
						"text": "Not without cause did he add, \"even until now;\" but to signify that they gained no ground by their refusing to condescend."

					},
					{
						"text": "\"And their conscience being weak is defiled\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "No where as yet doth he state his argument about the nature of the thing, but turns himself this way and that as concerning the conscience of the person partaking."
					},
					{
						"text": "For he was afraid lest in his wish to correct the weak person, he should inflict a heavy blow upon the strong one, and make him also weak."
					},
					{
						"text": "On which account he spares the one no less than the other."
					},

Why then has not such an one knowledge? Why is he weak?\"—I say, in order that they might not rejoin in these terms, he did not proceed immediately to point out clearly that for fear of the other's harm one ought to abstain: but having first made but a sort of skirmish upon mention of him, he points out what is more than this."

Since if not giving to the poor casteth one out of the kingdom, even though one should be a virgin; or rather, not giving liberally: (for even those virgins too had oil, only they had it not abundantly:) consider how great the evil will prove, to have wrought so many impieties?  \"What impieties?\" say you."

						"text": "Say not then, that such is an ordinary person, but consider he is a member of that body which holds together the whole: and as the eye, so also doth he cause the body to be a body."

					{
						"text": "\"Yea, with no other view,\" saith he, \"did He make the care He requires common, establishing unity in so great diversity, but that of all events there might be complete communion."
					},

						"text": "Because, if our care for our neighbor be the common safety, it follows also that our glory and our sadness must be common\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Three things therefore he here demands: the not being divided but united in perfection: the having like care for another: and the considering all that happens common."
					},
					{
						"text": "And as above he saith, \"He hath given more abundant honor to that part which lacked,\" because it needeth it; signifying that the very inferiority was become an introduction to greater honor; so here he equalizes them in respect of the care also which takes place mutually among them."
					},
					{
						"text": "For \"therefore did he cause them to partake of greater honor,\" saith he, \"that they might not meet with less care\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "And not from hence only, but also by all that befalls them, good and painful, are the members bound to one another."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thus often when a thorn is fixed in the heel, the whole body feels it and cares for it: both the back is bent and the belly and thighs are contracted, and the hands coming forth as guards and servants draw out what was so fixed, and the head stoops over it, and the eyes observe it with much care."
					},
					{
						"text": "So that even if the foot hath inferiority from its inability to ascend, yet by its bringing down the head it hath an equality, and is favored with the same honor; and especially whenever the feet are the cause of the head's coming down, not by favor but by their claim on it."
					},
					{
						"text": "And thus, if by being the more honorable it hath an advantage; yet in that, being so it owes such honor and care to the lesser and likewise equal sympathy: by this it indicates great equality."
					},
					{
						"text": "Since what is meaner than the heel? what more honorable than the head? Yet this member reaches to that, and moves them all together with itself."
					},
					{
						"text": "Again if anything is the matter with the eyes, all complain and all are idle: and neither do the feet walk nor the hands work, nor doth the stomach enjoy its accustomed food; and yet the affection is of the eyes."

For suppose there were no hell, yet in the midst of so great brightness to be rejected and to go away dishonored;—how great the punishment! For if even now, when the Emperor rideth in and his train with him, we contemplating each one of us our own poverty, derive not so much pleasure from the spectacle, as we endure dejection at having no share in what is going on about the Emperor, nor being near the Sovereign; what will it be then? Or thinkest thou it is a light punishment, not to be ranked in that company, not to be counted worthy of that unutterable glory, from that assemblage and those untold good things, to be cast forth some-wither far and distant?

For if, when we enter a prison and see its inmates, some squalid, some chained and famishing, some again shut up in darkness, we are moved with compassion, we shudder, we use all diligence that we may never be cast into that place; how will it be with us, when we are led and dragged away into the torture-dungeons themselves of hell? For not of iron are those chains, but of fire that is never quenched; nor are they that are set over us our fellows whom it is often possible even to mollify; but angels whom one may not so much as look in the face, exceedingly enraged at our insults to their Master."

This then let us also now consider with ourselves, and groan bitterly for the provocations we have offered our Benefactor; nor let us therefore presume, because though outraged He bears it with long-suffering; but rather for this very reason be full of remorse."

And if indeed one were building thee mansions where thou wert not going to remain, thou wouldest deem it to be a loss; but now, desirest thou here to be rich, whence possibly thou art to depart even before the evening?
