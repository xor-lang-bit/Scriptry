						"text": "\"And hath not sat in the seat of pestilence\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "He willed not an earthly kingdom, with pride, which is well taken for \"the seat of pestilence;\" for that there is hardly any one who is free from the love of rule, and craves not human glory."

						"text": "For a \"pestilence\" is disease widely spread, and involving all or nearly all."

Because, in his life, he cast forth his bowels\"."

					},
					{

					{
						"text": "\"Lest at any time the Lord be angry,\" is expressed with a doubt, not as regards the vision of the prophet to whom it is certain, but as regards those who are warned; for they, to whom it is not openly revealed, are wont to think with doubt of the anger of God."

						"text": "The words, \"I slept, and took rest; and rose, for the Lord will take me up,\" lead us to believe that this Psalm is to be understood as in the Person of Christ; for they sound more applicable to the Passion and Resurrection of our Lord, than to that history in which David's flight is described from the face of his rebellious son."
					},
					{
						"text": "And, since it is written of Christ's disciples, \"The sons of the bridegroom fast not as long as the bridegroom is with them;\"  it is no wonder if by his undutiful son be here meant that undutiful disciple who betrayed Him."

					{
						"text": "From whose face although it may be understood historically that He fled, when on his departure He withdrew with the rest to the mountain; yet in a spiritual sense, when the Son of God, that is the Power and Wisdom of God, abandoned the mind of Judas; when the Devil wholly occupied him; as it is written, \"The Devil entered into his heart,\" may it be well understood that Christ fled from his face; not that Christ gave place to the Devil, but that on Christ's departure the Devil took possession."
					},
					{
						"text": "Which departure, I suppose, is called a flight in this Psalm, because of its quickness; which is indicated also by the word of our Lord, saying, \"That thou doest, do quickly\"."

					{
						"text": "So even in common conversation we say of anything that does not come to mind, it has fled from me; and of a man of much learning we say, nothing flies from him."

					{
						"text": "And it may seem strange, whether in the history of the kings, when Absalom carried on war against his father; or in the history of the New Testament, when Judas was the betrayer of our Lord; how \"father's peace\" can be understood."
					},
					{
						"text": "But both in the former place they who read carefully, see that David in that war was at peace with his son, who even with sore grief lamented his death, saying, \"O Absalom, my son, would God I had died for thee!\" And in the history of the New Testament by that so great and so wonderful forbearance of our Lord; in that He bore so long with him as if good, when He was not ignorant of his thoughts; in that He admitted him to the Supper in which He committed and delivered to His disciples the figure of His Body and Blood; finally, in that He received the kiss of peace at the very time of His betrayal; it is easily understood how Christ showed peace to His betrayer, although he was laid waste by the intestine war of so abominable a device."

					},
					{

						"text": "And this Holy Spirit is in Scripture especially spoken of by the number seven, whether in Isaiah or in the Apocalypse, where the seven Spirits of God are most directly mentioned, on account of the sevenfold operation of one and the self-same Spirit And this sevenfold operation is mentioned in IsaiahHence also the Holy Spirit is spoken of under the number seven."

						"text": "Now in that some have believed that the Psalms are divided into five books, they have been led by the fact, that so often at the end of Psalms are the words, \"so be it, so be it\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "But when I endeavoured to make out the principle of this division, I was not able; for neither are the five parts equal one to another, neither in quantity of contents, nor yet even in number of Psalms, so as for each to contain thirty."
					},
					{
						"text": "And if each book end with, \"so be it, so be it,\" we may reasonably ask, why the fifth and last book hath not the same conclusion."
					},
					{
						"text": "We however, following the authority of canonical Scripture, where it is said, \"For it is written in the book of Psalms,\" know that there is but one book of Psalms."

						"text": "And when it is said, \"It is written in the book of Psalms,\" though the customary way of speaking is such that he seem to have wished to suggest that there is but one book, yet to this it may be answered, that the words mean \"in a book of the Psalms,\" that is, \"in any one of those five books\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "And this is in common language so unprecedented, or at least so rare, that we are only convinced that the twelve Prophets made one book, because we read in like manner, \"As it is written in the book of the Prophets\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "There are some too who call all the canonical Scriptures together one book, because they agree in a very wondrous and divine unity."
					},
					{
						"text": "Whichever then of these is understood, this book, in its parts of fifty Psalms each, gives an answer important and very worthy of consideration."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it seems to me not without significance, that the fiftieth is of penitence, the hundredth of mercy and judgment, the hundred and fiftieth of the praise of God in His saints."
					},
					{
						"text": "For thus do we advance to an everlasting life of happiness, first by condemning our own sins, then by living aright, that, having condemned our ill life, and lived a good life, we may attain to everlasting life."
					},
					{
						"text": "Our predestination is not wrought in ourselves, but in secret with Him, in His foreknowledge But we are called by the preaching of repentance."

					},
					{
						"text": "All these His saints are; as the Apostle saith, \"But we may be the righteousness of God in Him\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "If then they be the righteousness of God, which He hath wrought in them, why are they not also the strength of Christ which He hath wrought in them, that they should rise again from the dead? For in Christ's resurrection, \"strength\" is especially set forth to us, for in His Passion was weakness, as the Apostle saith And well doth it say, \"the firmament of His power\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it is the \"firmament of His power\" that He \"dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over Him\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Why should not they also be called \"the works of\" God's \"strength,\" which He hath done in them: yea rather, they themselves are the works of His strength; just as it is said, \"We are the righteousness of God in Him\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "For what more powerful than that He should reign for ever, with all His enemies put under His feet? Why should not they also be \"the multitude of His greatness\"? not that whereby He is great, but whereby He hath made them great, many as they are, that is, thousands of thousands."
					},
					{
						"text": "Just as righteousness too is understood in two ways, that whereby He is righteous, and that which He worketh in us, so as to make us His righteousness."
					},
					{
						"text": "These same saints are signified by all the musical instruments in succession, to praise God in."

					{
						"text": "The psaltery praiseth God from things above, the harp praiseth God from things below; I mean, from things in heaven, and things in earth, as He who made heaven and earth."
					},
					{
						"text": "We have already in another Psalm, explained that the psaltery hath that board, whereon the series of strings rests that it may give a better sound, above, whereas the harp has it below."
					},
					{
						"text": "\"Praise Him in the timbrel and choir\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "The \"timbrel\" praiseth God when the flesh is now changed, so that there is in it no weakness of earthly corruption."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the timbrel is made of leather dried and strengthened."
					},
					{
						"text": "The \"choir\" praiseth God when society made peaceful praiseth Him."

					{
						"text": "\"Praise Him on the strings and organ\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Both psaltery and harp, which have been mentioned above, have strings."
					},
					{
						"text": "But \"organ\" is a general name for all instruments of music, although usage has now obtained that those are specially called organ which are inflated with bellows: but I do not think that this kind is meant here For since organ is a Greek word, applied generally, as I have said, to all musical instruments, this instrument, to which bellows are applied, is called by the Greeks by another name: but it being called organ is rather a Latin and conversational usage."
					},
					{
						"text": "When then he saith, \"on the strings and organ,\" he seemeth to me to have intended to signify some instrument which hath strings."
					},
					{
						"text": "For it is not psalteries and harps only that have strings: but, because in the psaltery, and harp, on account of the sound from things below and things above, somewhat has been found which can be understood after this distinction, he hath suggested to us to seek some other meaning in the strings themselves: for they too are flesh, but flesh now set free from corruption."
					},
					{
						"text": "And to those, it may be, he added the organ, to signify that they sound not each separately, but sound together in most harmonious diversity, just as they are arranged in a musical instrument."
					},
					{
						"text": "For even then the saints of God will have their differences, accordant, not discordant, that is, agreeing, not disagreeing, just as sweetest harmony arises from sounds differing indeed, but not opposed to one another."
					},
					{
						"text": "\"Praise Him on the well-sounding cymbals, praise Him on cymbals of jubilation\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Cymbals touch one another in order to sound, and therefore are by some compared to our lips."
					},
					{
						"text": "But I think it better to understand that God is in a manner praised on the cymbal, when each is honoured by his neighbour, not by himself, and then honouring one another, they give praise to God."
					},
					{
						"text": "But lest any should understand such cymbals as sound without life, therefore I think he added, \"on cymbals of jubilation\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "For \"jubilation\" that is, unspeakable praise, proceedeth not, save from life."
					},
					{
						"text": "Nor do I think that I should pass over what musicians say, that there are three kinds of sounds, by voice, by breath, by striking: by voice, uttered by throat and windpipe, when man singeth without any instrument; by breath, as by pipe, or anything of that sort: by striking, as by harp, or anything of that kind."
					},
					{
						"text": "None then of these kinds is omitted here: for there is voice in the choir, breath in the trumpet, striking in the harp, representing mind, spirit, body, but by similitudes, not in the proper sense of the words."
					},
					{
						"text": "When then he proposed, \"Praise God in His saints,\" to whom said he this, save to themselves? And in whom are they to praise God, save in themselves? For ye, saith he, are \"His saints;\" ye are \"His strength,\" but that which He wrought in you; ye are \"His mighty works, and the multitude of His greatness,\" which He hath wrought and set forth in you."
					},
					{
						"text": "Ye are \"trumpet, psaltery, harp, timbrel, choir, strings, and organ, cymbals of jubilation sounding well,\" because sounding in harmony."
					},

						"text": "All these are ye: let nought that is vile, nought that is transitory, nought that is ludicrous, be here thought of."
