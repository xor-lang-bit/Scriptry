					},
					{
						"text": "For this reason especially I have taken this narrative for my subject, that I may draw to it such as do not know it, and not let such a treasure as this remain hidden out of sight."
					},
					{

					{
						"text": "Then let us not hastily pass by it, but examine it closely."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thus, the predictions which in the Gospels Christ utters, here we may see these actually come to pass; and note in the very facts the bright evidence of Truth which shines in them, and the mighty change which is taking place in the disciples now that the Spirit has come upon them."
					},
					{
						"text": "For example, they heard Christ say, \"Whoso believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do\" (John xiv."

					{
						"text": "): and that the Gospel should be preached in all the world (Ib."
					},
					{
						"text": "xxiv."
					},
					{
						"text": "): now all this, how it came to pass exactly as it was said, may be seen in this Book, and more besides, which He told them while yet with them."
					},
					{
						"text": "Here again you will see the Apostles themselves, speeding their way as on wings over land and sea; and those same men, once so timorous and void of understanding, on the sudden become quite other than they were; men despising wealth, and raised above glory and passion and concupiscence, and in short all such affections: moreover, what unanimity there is among them now; nowhere any envying as there was before, nor any of the old hankering after the preeminence, but all virtue brought in them to its last finish, and shining through all, with surpassing lustre, that charity, concerning which the Lord had given so many charges saying, \"In this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye love one another\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "(John xiii."
					},
					{
						"text": ") And then, besides, there are doctrines to be found here, which we could not have known so surely as we now do, if this Book had not existed, but the very crowning point of our salvation would be hidden, alike for practice of life and for doctrine."
					},
					{
						"text": "The greater part, however, of this work is occupied with the acts of Paul, who \"laboured more abundantly than they all\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "( Cor."
					},
					{
						"text": "xv."
					},
					{
						"text": ") And the reason is, that the author of this Book, that is, the blessed Luke, was his companion: a man, whose high qualities, sufficiently visible in many other instances, are especially shown in his firm adherence to his Teacher, whom he constantly followed."
					},
					{
						"text": "Thus at a time when all had forsaken him, one gone into Galatia, another into Dalmatia, hear what he says of this disciple: \"Only Luke is with me\"."
					},
					{

					},
					{

					},
					{
						"text": "So that there can be no mistake in attributing this work to him: and when I say, to him, I mean, to Christ."
					},
					{
						"text": "And why then did he not relate every thing, seeing he was with Paul to the end? We may answer, that what is here written, was sufficient for those who would attend, and that the sacred writers ever addressed themselves to the matter of immediate importance, whatever it might be at the time: it was no object with them to be writers of books: in fact, there are many things which they have delivered by unwritten tradition."
					},
					{
						"text": "Now while all that is contained in this Book is worthy of admiration, so is especially the way the Apostles have of coming down to the wants of their hearers: a condescension suggested by the Spirit who has so ordered it, that the subject on which they chiefly dwell is that which pertains to Christ as man."
					},
					{
						"text": "For so it is, that while they discourse so much about Christ, they have spoken but little concerning His Godhead; it was mostly of the Manhood that they discoursed, and of the Passion, and the Resurrection, and the Ascension."
					},
					{
						"text": "For the thing required in the first instance was this, that it should be believed that He was risen, and ascended into heaven."
					},
					{
						"text": "As then the point on which Christ himself most insisted was, to have it known that He was come from the Father, so is it this writer's principal object to declare, that Christ was risen from the dead, and was received up into Heaven, and that He went to God, and came from God."
					},
					{
						"text": "For, if the fact of His coming from God were not first believed, much more, with the Resurrection and Ascension added thereto, would the Jews have found the entire doctrine incredible."
					},
					{
						"text": "Wherefore gently and by degrees he leads them on to higher truths."
					},
					{
						"text": "Nay, at Athens Paul even calls Him man simply, without saying more (Acts xvii."
					},
					{
						"text": ")."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if, when Christ Himself spoke of His equality with the Father, they often attempted to stone Him, and called Him a blasphemer for this reason, it was little to be expected that they would receive this doctrine from the fishermen, and that too, with the Cross coming before it."
					},
					{
						"text": "But why speak of the Jews, seeing that even the disciples often upon hearing the more sublime doctrines were troubled and offended? Therefore also He told them, \"I have many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "(John xvi."
					},
					{
						"text": ") If those could not, who had been so long time with Him, and had been admitted to so many secrets, and had seen so many wonders, how was it to be expected that men, but newly dragged away from altars, and idols, and sacrifices, and cats, and crocodiles (for such did the Gentiles worship), and from the rest of their evil ways, should all at once receive the more sublime matters of doctrine? And how in particular should Jews, hearing as they did every day of their lives, and having it ever sounded in their ears, \"The Lord thy God is one Lord, and beside Him is none other\" (Deut."
					},
					{
						"text": "vi."
					},
					{
						"text": "): who also had seen Him hanging nailed on the Cross, nay, had themselves crucified and buried Him, and not seen Him even risen: when they were told that this same person was God and equal with the Father, how should they, of all men, be otherwise than shocked and revolted? Therefore it is that gently and little by little they carry them on, with much consideration and forbearance letting themselves down to their low attainments, themselves the while enjoying in more plentiful measure the grace of the Spirit, and doing greater works in Christ's name than Christ Himself did, that they may at once raise them up from their grovelling apprehensions, and confirm the saying, that Christ was raised from the dead."
					},
					{
						"text": "For this, in fact, is just what this Book is: a Demonstration of the Resurrection:  this being once believed, the rest would come in due course."
					},
					{
						"text": "The subject then and entire scope of this Book, in the main, is just what I have said."
					},
					{
						"text": "And now let us hear the Preface itself."
					},
					{
						"text": "\"The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and to teach\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "(v."
					},
					{
						"text": ") Why does he put him in mind of the Gospel? To intimate how strictly he may be depended upon."
					},
					{
						"text": "For at the outset of the former work he says, \"It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "(Luke i."
					},
					{
						"text": ") Neither is he content with his own testimony, but refers the whole matter to the Apostles, saying, \"Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "(Luke i."
					},
					{
						"text": ") Having then accredited his account in the former instance, he has no need to put forth his credentials afresh for this treatise, seeing his disciple has been once for all satisfied, and by the mention of that former work he has reminded him of the strict reliance to be placed in him for the truth."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if a person has shown himself competent and trustworthy to write of things which he has heard, and moreover has obtained our confidence, much more will he have a right to our confidence when he has composed an account, not of things which he has received from others, but of things which he has seen and heard."
					},
					{
						"text": "For thou didst receive what relates to Christ; much more wilt thou receive what concerns the Apostles."
					},
					{
						"text": "What then, (it may be asked), is it a question only of history, with which the Holy Spirit has nothing to do? Not so."
					},
					{
						"text": "For, if \"those delivered it unto us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word;\" then, what he says, is theirs."
					},
					{
						"text": "And why did he not say, 'As they who were counted worthy of the Holy Spirit delivered them unto us;' but \"Those who were eyewitnesses?\" Because, in matter of belief, the very thing that gives one a right to be believed, is the having learned from eyewitnesses: whereas the other appears to foolish persons mere parade and pretension."
					},
					{
						"text": "And therefore John also speaks thus: \"I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "(John."
					},
					{
						"text": "i."
					},
					{
						"text": ") And Christ expresses Himself in the same way to Nicodemus, while he was dull of apprehension, \"We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and no one receiveth our witness\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "(Ib."
					},
					{
						"text": "iii."
					},
					{
						"text": ") Accordingly, He gave them leave to rest their testimony in many particulars on the fact of their having seen them, when He said, \"And do ye bear witness concerning Me, because ye have been with Me from the beginning\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "(John xv."
					},
					{
						"text": ") The Apostles themselves also often speak in a similar manner; \"We are witnesses, and the Holy Spirit which God hath given to those that obey Him\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "(Acts ii."
					},
					{
						"text": "); and on a subsequent occasion, Peter, still giving assurance of the Resurrection, said, \"Seeing we did eat and drink with Him\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "(Acts x."
					},
					{
						"text": ") For they more readily received the testimony of persons who had been His companions, because the notion of the Spirit was as yet very much beyond them."
					},
					{
						"text": "Therefore John also at that time, in his Gospel, speaking of the blood and water, said, he himself saw it, making the fact of his having seen it equivalent, for them, to the highest testimony, although the witness of the Spirit is more certain than the evidence of sight, but not so with unbelievers."
					},
					{
						"text": "Now that Luke was a partaker of the Spirit, is abundantly clear, both from the miracles which even now take place; and from the fact that in those times even ordinary persons were gifted with the Holy Ghost; and again from the testimony of Paul, in these words, \"Whose praise is in the Gospel\" ( Cor."
					},
					{
						"text": "viii."
					},
					{
						"text": "); and from the appointment to which he was chosen: for having said this, the Apostle adds, \"But also appointed of the Churches to travel with us with this grace which is administered by us\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Now mark how unassuming he is."
					},
					{
						"text": "He does not say, The former Gospel which I preached, but, \"The former treatise have I made;\" accounting the title of Gospel to be too great for him; although it is on the score of this that the Apostle dignifies him: \"Whose praise,\" he says, \"is in the Gospel\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "But he himself modestly says, \"The former treatise have I made—O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and to teach:\" not simply \"of all,\" but from the beginning to the end; \"until the day,\" he says, \"in which He was taken up\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "And yet John says, that it was not possible to write all: for \"were they written, I suppose,\" says he, \"that even the world itself could not contain the books written\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "(John xxi."
					},
					{
						"text": ") How then does the Evangelist here say, \"Of all?\" He does not say \"all,\" but \"of all,\" as much as to say, \"in a summary way, and in the gross;\" and \"of all that is mainly and pressingly important\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Then he tells us in what sense he says all, when he adds, \"Which Jesus began both to do and to teach;\" meaning His miracles and teaching; and not only so, but implying that His doing was also a teaching."
					},
					{
						"text": "But now consider the benevolent and Apostolic feelings of the writer: that for the sake of a single individual he took such pains as to write for him an entire Gospel."
					},
					{
						"text": "\"That thou mightest have,\" he says, \"the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "(Luke i."

					},

					},

					},
					{
						"text": "(Ib."
					},
					{
						"text": "viii."
					},
					{
						"text": ") Again, He charged men to love their enemies; and He taught the same lesson on the Cross, when He prayed for those who were crucifying Him."

					},
					{
						"text": "Therefore the Apostles first taught by their conduct, and then by their words; nay rather they had no need of words, when their deeds spoke so loud."
					},
					{
						"text": "Nor is it wrong to speak of Christ's Passion as action, for in suffering all He performed that great and wonderful act, by which He destroyed death, and effected all else that He did for us."

						"text": "); i-e: they were spiritual words that He spake unto them, nothing human; either this is the meaning, or, that it was by the Spirit that He gave them commandments."

					{
						"text": "For if He shewed Himself in the greater, surely He did in the minor circumstance."
					},

					},
					{
						"text": "For the writer does not say \"forty days,\" but, \"during forty days\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "He came, and again disappeared; by this leading them on to higher conceptions, and no longer permitting them to stand affected towards Him in the same way as before, but taking effectual measures to secure both these objects, that the fact of His Resurrection should be believed, and that He Himself should be ever after apprehended to be greater than man."
					},
					{
						"text": "At the same time, these were two opposite things; for in order to the belief in His Resurrection, much was to be done of a human character, and for the other object, just the reverse."
					},
					{
						"text": "Nevertheless, both results have been effected, each when the fitting time arrived."
					},
					{
						"text": "But why did He appear not to all, but to the Apostles only? Because to the many it would have seemed a mere apparition, inasmuch as they understood not the secret of the mystery."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if the disciples themselves were at first incredulous and were troubled, and needed the evidence of actual touch with the hand, and of His eating with them, how would it have fared in all likelihood with the multitude? For this reason therefore by the miracles wrought by the Apostles He renders the evidence of His Resurrection unequivocal, so that not only the men of those times—this is what would come of the ocular proof—but also all men thereafter, should be certain of the fact, that He was risen."
					},
					{
						"text": "Upon this ground also we argue with unbelievers."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if He did not rise again, but remains dead, how did the Apostles perform miracles in His name? But they did not, say you, perform miracles? How then was our religion (ἔθνος) instituted? For this certainly they will not controvert nor impugn what we see with our eyes: so that when they say that no miracles took place, they inflict a worse stab upon themselves."
					},
					{
						"text": "For this would be the greatest of miracles, that without any miracles, the whole world should have eagerly come to be taken in the nets of twelve poor and illiterate men."
					},
					{
						"text": "For not by wealth of money, not by wisdom of words, not by any thing else of this kind, did the fishermen prevail; so that objectors must even against their will acknowledge that there was in these men a Divine power, for no human strength could ever possibly effect such great results."
					},
					{
						"text": "For this He then remained forty days on earth, furnishing in this length of time the sure evidence of their seeing Him in His own proper Person, that they might not suppose that what they saw was a phantom."
					},
					{
						"text": "And not content with this, He added also the evidence of eating with them at their board: as to signify this, the writer adds, \"And being at table with them, He commanded\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "(v."
					},
					{
						"text": ") And this circumstance the Apostles themselves always put forth as an fallible token of the Resurrection; as where they say, \"Who did eat and drink with Him\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "(Acts x."
					},
					{
						"text": ")  And what did He, when appearing unto them those forty days? Why, He conversed with them, says the writer, \"concerning the kingdom of God\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "(v."
					},
					{
						"text": ") For, since the disciples both had been distressed and troubled at the things which already had taken place, and were about to go forth to encounter great difficulties, He recovered them by His discourses concerning the future."
					},
					{
						"text": "\"He commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "(v."
					},
					{
						"text": ") First, He led them out to Galilee, afraid and trembling, in order that they might listen to His words in security."
					},
					{
						"text": "Afterwards, when they had heard, and had passed forty days with Him, \"He commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "Wherefore? Just as when soldiers are to charge a multitude, no one thinks of letting them issue forth until they have armed themselves, or as horses are not suffered to start from the barriers until they have got their charioteer; so Christ did not suffer these to appear in the field before the descent of the Spirit, that they might not be in a condition to be easily defeated and taken captive by the many."
					},
					{
						"text": "Nor was this the only reason, but also there were many in Jerusalem who should believe."
					},
					{
						"text": "And then again that it might not be said, that leaving their own acquaintance, they had gone to make a parade among strangers, therefore among those very men who had put Christ to death do they exhibit the proofs of His Resurrection, among those who had crucified and buried Him, in the very town in which the iniquitous deed had been perpetrated; thereby stopping the mouths of all foreign objectors."
					},
					{
						"text": "For when those even who had crucified Him appear as believers, clearly this proved both the fact of the crucifixion and the iniquity of the deed, and afforded a mighty evidence of the Resurrection."
					},
					{
						"text": "Furthermore, lest the Apostles should say, How shall it be possible for us to live among wicked and bloody men, they so many in number, we so few and contemptible, observe how He does away their fear and distress, by these words, \"But wait for the promise of the Father, which ye have heard of Me\"."
					},

					},
					{
						"text": "(John xvi."
					},
					{
						"text": ") And again, \"I will pray the Father, and He shall send you another Comforter, that He may abide with you\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "(ib."
					},
					{
						"text": "xiv."
					},
					{
						"text": ")  But why did the Holy Ghost come to them, not while Christ was present, nor even immediately after his departure, but, whereas Christ ascended on the fortieth day, the Spirit descended \"when the day of Pentecost,\" that is, the fiftieth, \"was fully come?\" (Acts ii."
					},
					{
						"text": ") And how was it, if the Spirit had not yet come, that He said, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost?\" (John xx."
					},
					{
						"text": ") In order to render them capable and meet for the reception of Him."
					},
					{
						"text": "For if Daniel fainted at the sight of an Angel (Dan."

					},
					{
						"text": "Either this then is to be said, or else that Christ spoke of what was to come, as if come already; as when He said, \"Tread ye upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the devil\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "(Luke x."
					},
					{
						"text": ") But why had the Holy Ghost not yet come? It was fit that they should first be brought to have a longing desire for that event, and so receive the grace."
					},
					{
						"text": "For this reason Christ Himself departed, and then the Spirit descended."
					},
					{
						"text": "For had He Himself been there, they would not have expected the Spirit so earnestly as they did."
					},
					{
						"text": "On this account neither did He come immediately after Christ's Ascension, but after eight or nine days."
					},
					{
						"text": "It is the same with us also; for our desires towards God are then most raised, when we stand in need."
					},
					{
						"text": "Accordingly, John chose that time to send his disciples to Christ when they were likely to feel their need of Jesus, during his own imprisonment."
					},
					{
						"text": "Besides, it was fit that our nature should be seen in heaven, and that the reconciliation should be perfected, and then the Spirit should come, and the joy should be unalloyed."
					},
					{
						"text": "For, if the Spirit being already come, Christ had then departed, and the Spirit remained; the consolation would not have been so great as it was."
					},
					{
						"text": "For in fact they clung to Him, and could not bear to part with Him; wherefore also to comfort them He said, \"It is expedient for you that I go away\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "(John xvi."
					},
					{
						"text": ") On this account He also waits during those intermediate days, that they might first despond for awhile, and be made, as I said, to feel their need of Him."

If, where the numbers were three thousand and five thousand, the doing of this thing had such splendid success, and none of them complained of poverty, how much more glorious would this be in so vast a multitude? And even of those that are without, who would not contribute?—But, to show that it is the living separately that is expensive and causes poverty, let there be a house in which are ten children: and the wife and the man, let the one work at her wool, the other bring his earnings from his outdoor occupation: now tell me, in which way would these spend most? by taking their meals together and occupying one house, or by living separately?

And wherein do these things deserve wonder? what are they better than the beggars that dance and pipe in the market-place?

						"text": "For if in the earlier times when this Grace had not shone forth in such greatness, when the estate of the Jews was solemn and renowned and glorious before all men, there was no difference, what could they say for themselves (τίνα ἂν ἔχοιεν λόγον εἰπεἵν;) now after so great a display of grace? And this is why he establishes it with so great earnestness."

					},
					{

					},
					{
						"text": "But consider! He had put the hearer in fear, had advanced against him the fearful day, had told him what an evil it is to be living in wickedness, had showed him that no man sinneth of ignorance, nor with impunity, but that even though he suffer no punishment now, yet he certainly will suffer it: then he wishes to make good next that the teaching of the Law was not a thing of great importance."

					{
						"text": "And in order that what he says may be more readily allowed, he leads him forward with the better things also in view, speaking on this wise: \"But glory and honor and peace to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "For here whatever good things a man hath, he hath with fightings, even if he be rich, if a prince, if a king."

					},
					{
						"text": "For when he says that as well the Jew as the Gentile is punished if he sin, he needs no reasonings: but when he wants to prove that the Gentile is honored also, he then needs a foundation for it also; as it seemed wonderful and extravagant if he who had heard neither Law nor Prophets, were to be honored upon his working good."
					},
					{
						"text": "And this is why (as I also said before) he exercises their hearing in the times before grace, that he might afterwards more treatably bring in, along with the faith, the acquiescence in these things also."

						"text": "Wonderful! What more than victory has he gained! For he shows, by reducing it to an absurdity, that it was not meet with God that it should be otherwise."

					{
						"text": "For it would then be a case of respecting of persons."
					},
					{
						"text": "But of such character God is not."

						"text": "That it is not quality of persons, but difference of actions."
					},

					},
					{

					},
					{
						"text": "The consequence of this would be thus expressed; For it is not because one is a Jew and the other a Gentile, that one is honored and the other disgraced, but it is from the works that either treatment comes."
					},
					{
						"text": "But he does not say so, since it would have roused the anger of the Jew, but he sets down something more, so bringing their haughty spirit yet lower, and quelling it for the admission of the other."

						"text": "For the greater the attention he enjoyed, the greater the punishment he will suffer."
					},
					{
						"text": "See how much greater is the necessity which he lays upon the Jews of a speedy recourse to grace! For in that they said, they needed not grace, being justified by the Law, he shows that they need it more than the Gentiles, considering they are liable to be punished more."

					},

					},
					{

How then shall we feel, when, before the whole world, all things are brought into the midst, in a theatre so bright and open, with both those known and those unknown to us seeing into everything? But alas! wherewith am I forced to affright you! with men's estimation! when I ought to use the fear of God, and His condemnation."

					},

					},
					{

					},
					{

					},
					{
						"text": "For it was not by taking a different one instead of the former, nor by changing this same one in substance, that Christ caused it to regain the victory: but He let it abide in its own nature, and yet made it bind on the crown of victory over sin, and then after the victory raised it up, and made it immortal."

					},
					{
						"text": "And this is why he added, \"to them that walk not after the flesh\"."
					},
					{
						"text": "For lest, after hearing that Christ hath delivered thee from the war of sin, and that the requisition (δικαίωμα) of the Law is fulfilled in thee, by sin having been \"condemned in the flesh,\" thou shouldest break up all thy defences; therefore, in that place also, after saying, \"there is therefore no condemnation,\" he added, \"to them that walk not after the flesh;\" and here also, \"that the requisition of the Law might be fulfilled in us,\" he proceeds with the very same thing; or rather, not with it only, but even with a much stronger thing."

					},
					{
						"text": "Now if this be thy reason for disparaging the flesh, because it is by its name that he calls the fleshly life, at this rate you are also for disparaging the world, because wickedness is often called after it, as Christ also said to His disciples, \"Ye are not of this world;\" and again to His brethren, He says, \"The world cannot hate you, but me it hateth\"."
