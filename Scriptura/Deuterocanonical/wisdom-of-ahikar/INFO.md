## About Ahikar


The Book of the Wisdom of Ahikar is a subtler tale that threads through the complex biblical theme of the scapegoat. Within this narrative, we observe the class known as Azazel, the scapegoat, performing roles in salvation under the control of God. This is a striking illustration of the proverb, The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead (Proverbs 11:8).

Throughout the story, we witness how the wicked are instruments in God's plan to save the righteous. This theme is echoed in the Book of Enoch, where Azazel is charged with ALL SIN. By weaving these elements together, the Book of the Wisdom of Ahikar presents a nuanced understanding of divine justice and the mysterious ways in which salvation is achieved.
