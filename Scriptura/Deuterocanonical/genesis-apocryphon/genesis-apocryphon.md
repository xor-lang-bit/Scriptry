# Genesis Apocryphon

**[1:1]** Then I considered whether the pregnancy was due to the Watchers and Holy Ones, or (should be ascribed) to the Nephil[im], and I grew perturbed about this child. 

**[1:2]** Then I, Lamech, became afraid and went to Batenosh, [my] w[ife … saying, “Dec]lare [to me] by the Most High, by the Lord of Greatness, by the E[ternal] King [whether the child comes from the] heavenly beings! 

**[1:3]** Everything will you truthfully tell me, whether [ … … ] you will tell me without lies: is this [ … … swear] by the Eternal King until you speak truthfully to me and not with lies [ … ].”

**[1:4]** Then Batenosh my wife spoke with me forcefully. [She we]pt and said, “O my brother and master, recall for yourself my pregnancy [ … … ] marital relations, and my breath within its sheath (?). (Can) I truthfully [tell you] everything?”

**[1:6]** When Batenosh my wife noticed that my face had changed (its) expression [ … … ] then she gained control of her emotion(s) and spoke with me.

**[1:7]** She said to me, “O my master and [brother, recall for yourself] my pregnancy. I swear to you by the Great Holy One, by the Ruler of Hea[ven] that this seed is yours, that this pregnancy is from you, that from you is the planting of [this] fruit [and that it is] not from any alien, or from any of the Watchers, or from any heavenly bein[g.

**[1:9]** Then I, Lamech, hurried to Methuselah, my father, and [communicated] all this to him [so that he might consult Enoch] his father, and come to know everything with certainty from him since he is loved and fav[ored by God, and with the Holy Ones] has his lot been apportioned, and (hence) they (God and the angels) reveal everything to him. 

**[1:10]** When Methuselah heard [these things], he hurried to Enoch, his father, to learn from him the truth of the whole matter [ … … ] his approval, and he (Enoch?) had previously gone to Parvayyim.

**[1:11]** There he found E[noch his father, and] he said to Enoch, his father, “O my father and master, I have co[me] to you [ … … ] and I say to you to not be angry with me because I have come here to y[ou … … ] respect for you [ … …]”

**[1:68]** A famine took place throughout all this land, but I heard that grai[n] wa[s avail]able in Egypt. So I moved to [enter] the land of Egypt [ … … … ] I reache[d] the Carmona River, one of the branches of the river [ … … ]. Now we [ … ] our land, and I [cro]ssed the seven branches of this river which [ … … … ]. Now we passed out of our land and entered the land of the children of Ham, the land of Egypt. 

**[1:69]** And I, Abram, dreamed a dream during the night of my entering the land of Egypt. I saw in my dream one cedar tree and one palm tree, [a very beautifu]l one, and huma[n] figures came and tried to chop down and uproot the cedar in order to leave the palm by itself. But the palm restrained (them) when she said, ‘Do not chop down the cedar, for both of us are from o[ne r]oot!’ And the cedar was left alone thanks to the protection of the palm and was not [chopped down]. 

**[1:70]** I woke up from my dream in the night, and said to Sarai, my wife, ‘I have (just) dreamed a dream, [and I] am afraid [on account of] this dream!’ And she said to me, ‘Tell me your dream that I might know (it), and so I began to relate this dream to her.

**[1:71]** [And I revealed] to [her the meaning of that] dream, and I [said, ‘… …] for they will seek to kill me, but you they will spare [… …] this, every favor [which you must do for me] in every [place] where [we are, say] of me that “he is my brother,” and I will remain alive by your protection and survive thanks to you.’

**[1:72]** [… … ‘they will try] to remove you from me and to kill me!’ And Sarai wept over my words that night. [… … … …] and Pharaoh Z[oan … … …] Sarai to go to Zoan [with me, for she was v]ery [careful] with her person so that no [one] would see her […]. 

**[1:73]** But after those five years, three men who were princes of Egypt [came … …] of Pharaoh Zoa[n] about my affairs and about my wife, and they presented [me numerous gifts and aske]d m[e to teach them] values, wisdom, and truth. 

**[1:74]** So I read in their presence the [book of] the words of [En]och [… … …] in the famine which [… … 1 ½ lines garbled … …] with much eating and [much] drinking [… … ] wine [… … … remainder of column, approximately 6-7 lines, lost … …].

**[1:75]** [… line 1 and first half of line 2 missing ….] … how excellent and beautiful is the expression on her face! And how pleasing [and how] delicate is the hair of her head! How beautiful are her eyes, and how pleasing is her nose and all the bloom of her face … how lovely is her breast, and how beautiful is all her fairness!

**[1:76]** Her arms, how beautiful! And her hands, how perfect! Any glimpse of her hands is to be desired! How lovely are her palms, and how long and slender are all the fingers of her hands! Her feet, how beautiful! And how perfect are her thighs! No maidens or brides who enter the bridal chamber are more beautiful than she is!

**[1:77]** The beautifulness of her beauty is superior to (that) of all (other) women, and her beauty is high above all of them! And with all this beauty she possesses much wisdom, and the work of her hands is beautiful.

**[1:78]** When the king heard the words of ḤRQNWŠ and the words of his two associates, since the three of them spoke with one voice (i.e., in accord), he loved her greatly. So he quickly sent (and) seized her. He saw her and was amazed at all her beauty, and he took her for a wife.

**[1:79]** And he sought to kill me, but Sarai said to the king: ‘He is my brother!’ that I might profit because of her. I, Abram, was spared because of her, and I was not killed. I, Abram, wept an intense weeping—I and Lot, the son of my brother (who was) with me—during the night when Sarai was led away from me by force. 

**[1:80]** During that night, I prayed and besought and implored. Aggrieved and (with) my tears streaming down, I said: ‘Praised are You, O God Most High, Lord of all the Ages, for You are Lord and Ruler over everything. You are the Ruler over all the kings of the earth in order to exercise judgment among all of them.

**[1:81]** And now, I make an accusation to You, O Lord, against Pharaoh Zoan, the king of Egypt, because my wife was led away from me by force. Exercise judgment on him for me, and manifest Your great power against him and against his entire household! May he (i.e., Pharaoh) not have the power to defile my wife for me tonight! Then they will know you, O my Lord, for You are Lord over all the kings of the earth!’ I wept and (then) I was silent.

**[1:82]** During that night God Most High sent a pestilential spirit to him (i.e., to Pharaoh) in order to afflict him and every person in his household—an evil spirit—and it kept attacking him and every person in his household. He was unable to approach her, and indeed he did not have sexual relations with her, and she remained with him for two years.

**[1:83]** At the end of two years the afflictions and scourgings intensified and strengthened against him and against every person in his household. So he sent for (and) summoned all the sage[s of] Egypt and (sent) for all the magicians along with all the physicians of Egypt (to see) if they were able to heal him and the people of his household of this affliction. But none of the physicians, magicians, or sages were able to endure so as to heal him, because that spirit attacked all of them (as well), and they fled. 

**[1:84]** Then ḤRQNWŠ came to me and asked of me that I should come and pray for the king and lay my hands upon him so that he might recover. For he had seen [me] in a dre[a]m. But Lot said to him: ‘My uncle Abram is unable to pray for the king while his wife Sarai remains with him. So now go (and) tell the king he should send his wife away from himself back to her husband. Then he will pray for him, and he will recover.’

**[1:85]**  When ḤRQNWŠ heard the words of Lot, he went (and) said to the king: ‘All these afflictions and scourgings with which my lord the king has been afflicted and scourged are on account of Sarai, the wife of Abram. Let them now return Sarai to her husband Abram, and this affliction and purulent spirit will stop!’ 

**[1:86]** So the [k]i[n]g summoned me and said to me: ‘What have you done to me because of [Sara]i? You said to me: “She is my sister,” but she was your wife! I took her as a wife for myself! Lo, here is your wife: lead her off, go, and depart from every city of Egypt! And now, pray for me and for my family, and let this wicked spirit be exorcized from us!’

**[1:87]** Then I prayed for [him that he might he]al quickly. I laid my hands upon his he[ad], and the affliction was removed from him and the evil [spirit] was exorcized [from him], and he recovered.

**[1:88]** The king arose and gave me on that d[ay] numerous gifts, and the king swore to me with an oath that he had not [molested] her. And he returned Sarai to me, and the king gave her a [la]rge quantity of si[lver and go]ld together with a large quantity of clothing of linen and purple that …. before her, and also Hagar. So he restored her to me, and he appointed people to accompany me who would take me out of Egypt. 

**[1:89]** So I, Abram, departed with very many possessions and also with silver and gold. I came up from [Egyp]t [and Lot], the son of my brother, was with me. Lot too had acquired for himself vast possessions, and he had taken a wife for himself from the [Egyptian] women. I was dw

**[1:90]** in] every place of my (previous) encampments until I arrived at Bethel, the place wherein I had built an altar. I built it a second time, [and] I offered burnt offerings and a grain offering on it to God Most High. I invoked there the name of the Lord of the Ages and I gave praise to the name of God, and I blessed God and I gave thanks there before God for all the possessions and goods which He had given to me, and because of the good which He had done for me, and because He had returned me to this land safely. 

**[1:91]** After this day Lot separated from me because of the conduct of our shepherds. He went and made his dwelling in the Jordan valley, and all of his flocks were with him. I moreover added greatly to what he already possessed. He pastured his flocks and arrived at Sodom. He bought a house for himself in Sodom and dwelt in it. I was dwelling in the hill country of Bethel. It was distressful to me that Lot, the son of my brother, had separated from me. 

**[1:92]**  Then God appeared to me in a night-vision and said to me: ‘Go up to Ramath-Ḥaṣor which is to the north of Bethel, the place where you dwell, and lift up your eyes and look to the east and to the west and to the south and to the north, and look at all this land which I am giving to you and to your descendants <for> all the ages!’ 

**[1:93]** So the following day I went up to Ramath-Ḥaṣor, and I viewed the land from this high place: from the river of Egypt to Lebanon and Senir, and from the great sea (i.e., the Mediterranean) to the Ḥauran, and all the land of Gebal up to Qadesh, and the whole of the great desert which is east of the Ḥauran and Senir as far as the Euphrates. 

**[1:94]** And He said to me: ‘To your descendants I will give all of this land, and they will have possession of it for all ages. I will multiply your descendants (to be) like the dust of the ground which no person is able to count—your descendants will likewise be impossible to count. Arise, walk, go and see how long it is and how wide it is, because I will give it to you and to your descendants after you forever!’ 

**[1:95]** I, Abram, went out to travel around and to see the land. I began to travel around from the Giḥon river, and I went along the side of the (Mediterranean) Sea until I arrived at Mt. Taurus. Then I traveled away from the si[de] of this great sea of salt, and I went along the east side of Mt. Taurus through the breadth of the land until I arrived at the Euphrates river. I traveled along the side of the Euphrates until I reached the Red Sea toward the east. I continued going along the side of the Red Sea until I reached the inlet (lit. ‘tongue’) of the Sea of Reeds which emerges from the Red Sea, and then I traveled toward the south until I arrived at the Giḥon river. I turned and came back to my house safely, and I found all my people to be well.

**[1:96]** Then I went and dwelt at the oaks of Mamre which were in Hebron—more like to the northeast of Hebron—and I built an altar there. I offered on it a burnt-offering and a cereal offering to God Most High. I ate and I drank there, I and all the people of my household, and I sent for (and) invited Mamre, Arnem, and Eshkol, the three Amorite brothers (who were) my friends, and they ate together with me and drank with me. 

**[1:97]** Before these days, Kedorlaomer the king of Elam had come (along with) Amraphel the king of Babylon, Arioch the king of Kappatuk (i.e., Cappadocia), and Tidal the king of Goyyim which is between the two rivers. They made war with Bera‘ the king of Sodom and with Birsha‘ the king of Gomorrah and with Shinab the king of Admah and with Shemiabad the king of Ṣeboyyin and with the king of Bela‘. All of these met together for battle at the valley of Siddaya, and the king of Elam and the kings who were with him were stronger than the king of Sodom and all his allies. They imposed a tribute upon them. 

**[1:98]** For twelve years they gave their tribute to the king of Elam, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled against him. In the fourteenth year, the king of Elam led forth all his allies, and they came up the road of the desert and were attacking and plundering, starting from the Euphrates river. They attacked the Rephaim who were in Ashterot of Qarnain, the Zumzamim who were in Ammon, the Emim w[ho were in] Shaveh-Haqariot, and the Ḥorites who were in the mountains of Gebal until they arrived at El-Paran which is in the desert. They then turned back and attacked ‘Eyn-Dina [and the people] who were in Ḥaṣeṣon-Tamar. 

**[1:99]** The king of Sodom came forth to meet them, with the king of [Gomorrah and the k]ing of Admah and the king of Ṣeboyyin and the king of Bela‘. The[y d]id battle in the valley o[f Siddaya] against Kedorla[omer, the king of Elam, and the kings] who were with him. The king of Sodom was defeated and was routed, and the king of Gomorrah fell into pits [of tar? …] …. The king of Elam looted all the possessions of Sodom and of [Go]morr[ah …] …. And they captured Lot, the son of the brother

**[1:100]** of Abram who was dwelling in Sodom, together with them along with all his possessions. One of the shepherds of the flock whom Abram had given to Lot who had escaped capture came unto Abram, and Abram was then living in Hebron, and informed him that Lot, the son of his brother, had been captured along with all his possessions, and he had not been killed. (He also told him) that the kings had proceeded along the great valley road in the direction of [?] taking captives, looting, attacking, and killing, going toward the city of Damascus. Abram wept on account of Lot, the son of his brother. Then he composed himself, arose, and selected from among his servants men chosen to do battle, (being) three hundred and eighteen (in number). Arnem, Eshkol, and Mamre proceeded with him. He pursued after them until he reached Dan, and he found them camping in the valley of Dan. During the night he cast (missiles) onto them from their four sides, and he was killing them during the night. He defeated them, and he chased them, and all of them were fleeing before him until they reached Ḥelbon, placed to the north of Damascus. 

**[1:101]** He rescued from them everyone whom they had captured, and everything which they had plundered along with all their goods, and he also delivered Lot, the son of his brother, and all of his property. Every captive whom they had captured he brought back. The king of Sodom heard that Abram had brought back all the captives and all the loot, and he went up to meet him. He came to Salem; i.e., Jerusalem, and Abram pitched camp in the valley of Shaveh; i.e., the valley of the king, the valley of Beth Karma. 

**[1:102]** Melchizedek, the king of Salem, brought out food and drink for Abram and for all the men who were with him. He was a priest of God Most High, and he blessed Abram and said: ‘May Abram be blessed by God Most High, the Lord of the heavens and earth! Praised be God Most High Who has delivered your enemies into your grasp!’ And he gave to him a tenth of all the possessions of the king of Elam and his allies.

**[1:103]**  Then the king of Sodom approached and said to Abram: ‘My lord Abram, give to me the persons who are mine (now) with you who were captives whom you rescued from the king of Elam. All their possessions are left for you!’ 

**[1:104]** Then Abram said to the king of Sodom: ‘I raise my hand this day to God Most High, the Lord of heavens and earth, (that) I will not take even a thread or a strap of a shoe of anything that belongs to you lest you be saying  “all the wealth of Abram came from my property,” with the exception of what my servants who were with me have already consumed, and with the exception of the share of the three men who went with me. They are in charge of their share for granting to you!’ Abram returned all the possessions and all the captives, and he gave (them) to the king of Sodom. All the captives who were still with him from that land, he released and sent away all of them. 

**[1:105]** After these things, God appeared to Abram in a vision and said to him: ‘Behold! It has been ten complete years since the day you departed from Ḥarran: two you spent here, seven in Egypt, and one after you returned from Egypt. And now, examine and count everything which you own, and see how many doublings they have increased compared to everything which came out with you on the day of your departure from Ḥarran! So fear not, for I am with you. I will be a support and strength for you. I am a shield over you and a buckler for you with respect to anyone stronger than you. Your wealth and your possessions will greatly increase!’ 

**[1:106]** Abram said: ‘My Lord God! I have much wealth and possessions, but what good are all these things to me? I, when I die, will depart naked, for there are no children. One of the members of my household will inherit from me, Eliezer, a member [of my household ….] will be my heir.’ He said to him: ‘No, this one will not inherit from you! Instead, the one who will come forth [from your loins will inherit from you].
