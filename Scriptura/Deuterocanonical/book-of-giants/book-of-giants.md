**[1:2]** Then Shahmīzād said to Sām, his [son]: "All that Māhawai ..., is spoilt (?).

**[1:3]** Thereupon he said to ... "We are ... until ... and ... that are in (?) the fiery hell (?) ...

**[1:4]** As my father, Virōgdād, was ..."

**[1:5]** Shahmīzād said: "It is true what he says. He says one of thousands. For one of thousands ..."

**[1:6]** Sām thereupon began ... Māhawai, too, in many places ... until to that place he might escape and ...

**[1:7]** Virōgdād ... Hōbābīš robbed Ahr ... of -naxtag, his wife.

**[1:8]** Thereupon the giants began to kill each other and [to abduct their wives].

**[1:9]** The creatures, too, began to kill each other.

**[1:10]** Sām ... before the sun, one hand in the air, the other ... whatever he obtained, to his brother ...

**[1:20]** Not the ... eagle, but his wings. Not the ... gold, but the brass that hammers it. Not the proud [ruler], but the diadem on his [head]. Not the splendid cypress, but the ... of the mountain ...

**[1:21]** ... Not he that engages in quarrels, but he that is true in his speech. Not the evil fruit(?), but the poison in it. [Not they that] are placed (?) in the skies but the God [of all] worlds. 

**[1:22]** Not the servant is proud, but [the lord] that is above him. Not one that is sent ..., but the man that sent him." 

**[1:23]** Thereupon Narīmān ... said ... And (in) another place I saw those that were weeping for the ruin that had befallen them, and whose cries and laments rose up to heaven.

**[1:42]** The Hearer who gives alms (to the Elect), is like unto a poor man that presents his daughter to the king; he reaches (a position of) great honour.

**[1:43]** In the body of the Elect the (food given to to him as) alms is purified in the same manner as a ... that by fire and wind ... beautiful clothes on a clean body ... turn ...

**[1:44]** ... witness ... fruit ... tree ... like firewood ... like a grain (?) ... radiance. 

**[1:45]** The Hearer in [the world?], (and) the alms within the Church, are like unto a ship [on the sea]: the towing-line (is) in the hand of [the tower] on shore, the sailor is [on board the ship].

**[1:46]** The sea is the world, the ship is [the ... , the ... is the ?al]ms, the tower is [the ... ?], the towing-line (?) is the Wisdom.

**[1:64]** And again, besides this (voice), I heard the voice of Enoch, the apostle, from the south, without, however, seeing him at all. Speaking my name very lovingly, he called.

**[1:65]** And downwards from ... then ... for the closed door of the sun will open, the sun's light and heat will descend and set your wings alight. You will burn and die," said he.

**[1:66]** Having heard these words, I beat my wings and quickly flew down from the air. I looked back: Dawn had ... with the light of the sun it had come to rise over the Kögmän mountains.

**[1:67]** And again a voice came from above. Bringing the command of Enoch, the apostle, it said: "I call you, Virōgdād, ... I know ... his direction ... you ... you ... Now quickly ... people ... also ...
