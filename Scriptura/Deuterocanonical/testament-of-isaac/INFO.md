## Time of Circulation and Related Works -- Notes from the AI:

The **Testament of Isaac** is believed to have been written between **200 AD and 400 AD**. While its exact date is difficult to pinpoint, scholars agree that it reflects the blend of Jewish and early Christian eschatological themes common to that period.

This text is closely related in tone and message to other works such as the **Book of Enoch**, the **Testament of Abraham**, and the **Apocalypse of Peter**. These texts share vivid descriptions of the afterlife, divine judgment, and the torments of the wicked, emphasizing the idea of divine justice and the moral consequences of one's actions.

This text was edited and translated by **James H. Charlesworth**, who contributed significantly to the study and preservation of pseudepigraphal literature.
