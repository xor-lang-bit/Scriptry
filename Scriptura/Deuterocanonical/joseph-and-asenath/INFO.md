## About this text, written by AI:

The text **"Joseph and Asenath"** is believed to have originated from **Hellenistic Egypt** between **100 B.C.E. and 100 C.E.**. It tells a romantic story of Joseph and Asenath's courtship, expanding on the brief mentions of their relationship in the Book of Genesis. The narrative includes themes of conversion and romance, which are not typically found in the canonical texts.

### Time of Circulation and Related Works

The **"Joseph and Asenath"** text likely circulated during the Hellenistic period, around **100 B.C.E. to 100 C.E.**. This aligns with the period when Jewish communities were thriving in Egypt, particularly in Alexandria, and where many Jewish texts were written or translated, including the Septuagint.

### Authenticity Debate

- **Richard Cole**: "The ultimate provenance of the work is uncertain. Suggestions have ranged from 200 B.C. to 300 A.D. from North Africa in the west through to Palestine and Syria in the east."
- **Gideon Bohak**: "The geographical location of the story (Heliopolis) and an important Jewish diaspora community centered on a Jewish temple in Leontopolis, located in the nome of Heliopolis during the Ptolemaic period, seeing this as the likely starting point."
