## About this text, written by AI:

The Five Psalms of David, as presented here, include a mix of traditional psalms attributed to King David and additional psalms from other revered biblical figures. This collection, found in a Syriac manuscript discussed by W. Wright, notably includes a psalm attributed to Hezekiah, known as "The Prayer of Hezekiah when enemies surrounded him." 

While the title suggests a sole association with David, these psalms reflect a broader tapestry of biblical voices, each contributing to the rich spiritual heritage preserved within these texts. The collection aims to continue the mission of projects like Scrollmapper on GitHub, dedicated to preserving and transmitting these ancient works, specifically focusing on rediscovering the lost 70 books referenced in 2 Esdras.
